abstract={This study assesses the impact of the farming system on the levels of copper, zinc, arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury in pig tissues from three types of production (Organic (n = 28), Label Rouge (n = 12) and Conventional (n = 30)) randomly sampled in different slaughterhouses. All the concentrations were below regulatory limits. In muscles, Cu, Zn and As were measured at slightly higher levels in organic samples but no differences between organic and Label Rouge was observed. Livers from conventional and Label Rouge pig farms exhibited higher Zn and Cd contents than the organic ones, probably due to different practice in zinc or phytase supplementation of fattening diets. Principal component analysis indicated a correlation between Cu and As concentrations in liver and carcass weight, and between Zn and Cd liver levels and lean meat percentage. The linear discriminant analysis succeeded in predicting the farming process on the basis of the lean meat percentage and the liver Cd level. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The gold-standard matrix for measuring the internal levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is the adipose tissue, however in epidemiological studies the use of serum is preferred due to the low cost and higher accessibility. The interpretation of serum biomarkers is tightly related to the understanding of the underlying causal structure relating the POPs, serum lipids and the disease. Considering the extended benefits of using serum biomarkers we aimed to further examine if through statistical modelling we would be able to improve the use and interpretation of serum biomarkers in the study of endometriosis. Hence, we have conducted a systematic comparison of statistical approaches commonly used to lipid-adjust the circulating biomarkers of POPs based on existing methods, using data from a pilot case-control study focused on severe deep infiltrating endometriosis. The odds ratios (ORs) obtained from unconditional regression for those models with serum biomarkers were further compared to those obtained from adipose tissue. The results of this exploratory study did not support the use of blood biomarkers as proxy estimates of POPs in adipose tissue to implement in risk models for endometriosis with the available statistical approaches to correct for lipids. The current statistical approaches commonly used to lipid-adjust circulating POPs, do not fully represent the underlying biological complexity between POPs, lipids and disease (especially those directly or indirectly affecting or affected by lipid metabolism). Hence, further investigations are warranted to improve the use and interpretation of blood biomarkers under complex scenarios of lipid dynamics. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Perinatal undernutrition affects not only fetal and neonatal growth but also adult health outcome, as suggested by the metabolic imprinting concept. However, the exact mechanisms underlying offspring metabolic adaptations are not yet fully understood. Specifically, it remains unclear whether the gestation or the lactation is the more vulnerable period to modify offspring metabolic flexibility. We investigated in a rodent model of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) induced by maternal protein restriction (R) during gestation which time window of maternal undernutrition (gestation, lactation or gestation–lactation) has more impact on the male offspring metabolomics phenotype. Plasma metabolome and hepatic lipidome of offspring were characterized through suckling period and at adulthood using liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry. Multivariate analysis of these fingerprints highlighted a persistent metabolomics signature in rats suckled by R dams, with a clear-cut discrimination from offspring fed by control (C) dams. Pups submitted to a nutritional switch at birth presented a metabolomics signature clearly distinct from that of pups nursed by dams maintained on a consistent perinatal diet. Control rats suckled by R dams presented transiently higher branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) oxidation during lactation besides increased fatty acid (FA) β-oxidation, associated with preserved insulin sensitivity and lesser fat accretion that persisted throughout their life. In contrast, IUGR rats displayed permanently impaired β-oxidation, associated to increased glucose or BCAA oxidation at adulthood, depending on the fact that pups experienced slow postnatal or catch-up growth, as suckled by R or C dams, respectively. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for a significant contribution of the lactation period in metabolic programming. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

Our results demonstrate that a profiling strategy based on fast 2D NMR spectra recorded in 2.4 min is more efficient than the standard 1D experiments to classify oils from different botanical origins, since 1D spectra on the same samples suffer from strong peak overlaps. Six edible oils with different botanical origins (olive, hazelnut, sesame, rapeseed, corn and sunflower) have been clearly discriminated by PCA analysis. Furthermore, we show how this approach combined with a PLS model can detect adulteration processes such as the addition of hazelnut oil into olive oil, a common fraud in food industry. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={An untargeted strategy aiming at identifying non-intentionally added substances (NIAS) migrating from coatings was developed. This innovative approach was applied to two polyester-polyurethane lacquers, for which suppliers previously provided the identity of the monomers involved. Lacquers were extracted with acetonitrile and analyzed by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Data, acquired in the full scan mode, were processed using an open-source R-environment (xcms and CAMERA packages) to list the detected features and deconvolute them in groups related to individual compounds. The most intense groups, accounting for more than 85% of cumulated feature intensities, were then investigated. A homemade database, populated with predicted polyester oligomer combinations from a relevant selection of diols and diacids, enabled highlighting the presence of 14 and 17 cyclic predicted polyester oligomers in the two lacquers, including three mutual combinations explained by common known monomers. Combination hypotheses were strengthened by chromatographic considerations and by the investigation of fragmentation patterns. Regarding unpredicted migrating substances, four monomers were hypothesised to explain several polyester or caprolactam oligomer series. Finally, considering both predicted and tentatively elucidated unpredicted oligomers, it was possible to assign hypotheses to features representing up to 82% and 90% of the cumulated intensities in the two lacquers, plus 9% and 3% (respectively) originating from the procedural blank.

abstract={Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) and Dechlorane Plus (DP) are two chlorinated, alternative flame retardants that have been found in wild birds and bird eggs. Little is known about the fate and effect of these compounds in birds, especially during the vulnerable stages of embryonic development. To investigate the ability of birds to biotransform these compounds, an in ovo exposure experiment with Japanese quail eggs was performed. Quail eggs were injected in the yolk sac with 1000 ng/g egg of TDCIPP (2.3 nmol/g ww), DP (1.5 nmol/g ww) or a mixture of both and were then incubated at 37.5 °C for 17 days. To get a time-integrated understanding of the in ovo transformation of the compounds, one egg per treatment was removed from the incubator every day and analyzed for TDCIPP and its metabolite bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP) and/or for DP. By the end of the incubation period, TDCIPP was completely metabolized, while simultaneously BDCIPP was formed. The conversion of the parent compound into the metabolite did not occur proportionally and the concentration of BDCIPP showed a tendency to decrease when TDCIPP became depleted, both indicating that BDCIPP was further transformed into compounds not targeted for analysis. Further untargeted investigations did not show the presence of other metabolites, possibly due to the volatility of the metabolites. On the other hand, the DP concentration did not decrease during egg incubation. This study indicates that within the incubation period, avian embryos are able to biotransform TDCIPP, but not DP. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Human milk is recommended for feeding preterm infants. The current pilot study aims to determine whether breast-milk lipidome had any impact on the early growth-pattern of preterm infants fed their own mother’s milk. A prospective-monocentric-observational birth-cohort was established, enrolling 138 preterm infants, who received their own mother’s breast-milk throughout hospital stay. All infants were ranked according to the change in weight Z-score between birth and hospital discharge. Then, we selected infants who experienced “slower” (n = 15, −1.54 ± 0.42 Z-score) or “faster” (n = 11, −0.48 ± 0.19 Z-score) growth; as expected, although groups did not differ regarding gestational age, birth weight Z-score was lower in the “faster-growth” group (0.56 ± 0.72 vs. −1.59 ± 0.96). Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry lipidomic signatures combined with multivariate analyses made it possible to identify breast-milk lipid species that allowed clear-cut discrimination between groups. Validation of the selected biomarkers was performed using multidimensional statistical, false-discovery-rate and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) tools. Breast-milk associated with faster growth contained more medium-chain saturated fatty acid and sphingomyelin, dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA)-containing phosphethanolamine, and less oleic acid-containing triglyceride and DGLA-oxylipin. The ability of such biomarkers to predict early-growth was validated in presence of confounding clinical factors but remains to be ascertained in larger cohort studies. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={Concern has been raised over increased male reproductive disorders in the Western world, and the disruption of male endocrinology has been suggested to play a central role. Several studies have shown that mild analgesics exposure during fetal life is associated with antiandrogenic effects and congenital malformations, but the effects on the adult man remain largely unknown. Through a clinical trial with young men exposed to ibuprofen, we show that the analgesic resulted in the clinical condition named “compensated hypogonadism," a condition prevalent among elderly men and associated with reproductive and physical disorders. In the men, luteinizing hormone (LH) and ibuprofen plasma levels were positively correlated, and the testosterone/LH ratio decreased. Using adult testis explants exposed or not exposed to ibuprofen, we demonstrate that the endocrine capabilities from testicular Leydig and Sertoli cells, including testosterone production, were suppressed through transcriptional repression. This effect was also observed in a human steroidogenic cell line. Our data demonstrate that ibuprofen alters the endocrine system via selective transcriptional repression in the human testes, thereby inducing compensated hypogonadism.},

abstract={Body mass index is a known breast cancer risk factor due to, among other mechanisms, adipose-derived hormones. We developed a method for steroid hormone profiling in adipose tissue to evaluate healthy tissue around the tumor and define new biomarkers for cancer development. A semi-automated sample preparation method based on gel permeation chromatography and subsequent derivatization with trimethylsilyl (TMS) is presented. Progestagens and androgens were determined by GC-EI-MS/MS (LOQ 0.5 to 10 ng/g lipids). For estrogen measurement, a highly sensitive GC-APCI-MS/MS method was developed to reach the required lower limits of detection (0.05 to 0.1 ng/g lipids in matrix, 100–200 fg on column for pure standards). The combination of the two methods allows the screening of 27 androgens and progestagens and 4 estrogens from a single sample. Good accuracies and repeatabilities were achieved for each compound class at their respective limit of detection. The method was applied to determine steroid hormone profiles in adipose tissue of 51 patients, collected both at proximity and distant to the tumor. Out of the 31 tested steroid hormones, 14 compounds were detected in human samples. Pregnenolone, 17-hydroxypregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and androstendione accounted together for 80% of the observed steroid hormone profiles, whereas the estrogens accounted for only 1%. These profiles did not differ based on sampling location, except for ß-estradiol; steroid hormone conversions from androgens to estrogens that potentially take place in adipose or tumoral tissue might not be detectable due a factor 100 difference in concentration of for example DHEA and ß-estradiol.

abstract={Background Using an organotypic culture system termed human Fetal Testis Assay (hFeTA) we previously showed that 0.01 μM BPA decreases basal, but not LH-stimulated, testosterone secreted by the first trimester human fetal testis. The present study was conducted to determine the potential for a long-term antiandrogenic effect of BPA using a xenograft model, and also to study the effect of BPA on germ cell development using both the hFETA and xenograft models. Methods Using the hFeTA system, first trimester testes were cultured for 3 days with 0.01 to 10 μM BPA. For xenografts, adult castrate male nude mice were injected with hCG and grafted with first trimester testes. Host mice received 10 μM BPA (~ 500 μg/kg/day) in their drinking water for 5 weeks. Plasma levels of total and unconjugated BPA were 0.10 μM and 0.038 μM respectively. Mice grafted with second trimester testes received 0.5 and 50 μg/kg/ day BPA by oral gavage for 5 weeks. Results With first trimester human testes, using the hFeTA model, 10 μM BPA increased germ cell apoptosis. In xenografts, germ cell density was also reduced by BPA exposure. Importantly, BPA exposure significantly decreased the percentage of germ cells expressing the pluripotency marker AP-2γ, whilst the percentage of those expressing the pre-spermatogonial marker MAGE-A4 significantly increased. BPA exposure did not affect hCG-stimulated androgen production in first and second trimester xenografts as evaluated by both plasma testosterone level and seminal vesicle weight in host mice. Conclusions Exposure to BPA at environmentally relevant concentrations impairs germ cell development in first trimester human fetal testis, whilst gonadotrophin-stimulated testosterone production was unaffected in both first and second trimester testis. Studies using first trimester human fetal testis demonstrate the complementarity of the FeTA and xenograft models for determining the respective short-term and long term effects of environmental exposures. © 2018 Eladak et al.

abstract={A probabilistic and interdisciplinary risk–benefit assessment (RBA) model integrating microbiological, nutritional, and chemical components was developed for infant milk, with the objective of predicting the health impact of different scenarios of consumption. Infant feeding is a particular concern of interest in RBA as breast milk and powder infant formula have both been associated with risks and benefits related to chemicals, bacteria, and nutrients, hence the model considers these three facets. Cronobacter sakazakii, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCB), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were three risk/benefit factors selected as key issues in microbiology, chemistry, and nutrition, respectively. The present model was probabilistic with variability and uncertainty separated using a second-order Monte Carlo simulation process. In this study, advantages and limitations of undertaking probabilistic and interdisciplinary RBA are discussed. In particular, the probabilistic technique was found to be powerful in dealing with missing data and to translate assumptions into quantitative inputs while taking uncertainty into account. In addition, separation of variability and uncertainty strengthened the interpretation of the model outputs by enabling better consideration and distinction of natural heterogeneity from lack of knowledge. Interdisciplinary RBA is necessary to give more structured conclusions and avoid contradictory messages to policymakers and also to consumers, leading to more decisive food recommendations. This assessment provides a conceptual development of the RBA methodology and is a robust basis on which to build upon. © 2017 Society for Risk Analysis},

abstract={In this paper, exposure to Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) related to bovine meat consumption is assessed based on multiples sources of data, namely data collected within the national research project “SoMeat” that objectively assesses the potential risks and benefits of organic and conventional food production systems in terms of contaminants respective contents. The work focuses on dioxin like PCBs in bovine meat in France. A modular Bayesian approach is proposed including measures after production, effect of cooking, levels and frequency of consumption and effect of digestion. In each module, a model is built and prior information can be integrated through previously acquired data commonly used in food risk assessment or vague priors. The output of the global model is the exposure including both production modes (organic and conventional) for three different cooking intensities (rare, medium, and well-done), before digestion and after digestion. The main results show that organic meat is more contaminated than conventional meat in mean after production stage and after cooking although cooking reduces the contamination level. This work is a first step of refined risk assessment integrating different steps such as cooking and digestion in the context of chemical risk assessment similarly to current microbiological risk assessments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The present study addresses the hypothesis that the concentration of tetrahydroxylated Polycylic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (tetra-OH-PAHs) in hair might be a useful biomarker of human exposure to PAHs, providing quantitative assessment of the internal dose, as well as information on the associated toxicity in relation to individual's specific metabolism. By means of animal models, this work aimed at identifying new tetra-OH-PAHs which can be released from the hydrolysis of DNA-adducts and can also be directly detected in biological matrices usually used in the field of biomonitoring such as hair and urine. Results obtained from a targeted gas chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) approach, demonstrated the presence of 8 tetrahydroxylated metabolites in DNA and 23 in hairs of rats exposed to mixtures of PAHs, which had never been analyzed before. Ten tetra-OH-PAHs were clearly characterized by using their analytical standards, corresponding to 4 parent PAHs (phenanthrene, chrysene, benz[a]anthracene and benzo[a]pyrene) whereas 13 tetra-OH-PAHs from 3 other parents (anthracene, fluoranthene and benz[k]fluoranthene) were detected but not yet characterized. No tetrahydroxylated metabolite has been clearly identified for naphthalene, fluorene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[g,h,i]perylene, or dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, which can all potentially form adducts. The relevance of tetra-OH-PAH analysis in hair as biomarkers of PAH exposure was evaluated in a dose-response study conducted on 64 rats (Long Evans females/n = 8 per groups) under repeated exposure (3 times per week) to a mixture of 16 PAHs at low doses (0.01–0.8 mg/kg) for 90 days. Most of the tetra-OH-PAHs targeted in the method were detected in the hairs of the rats, regardless of the dose of exposure. Significant linear relationships (R2 ranging from 0.558 to 0.964, p &lt; 0.001) were observed between the administered dose and the tetra-OH-PAH concentrations in the hairs for 20 out of the 23 metabolites. By widening the range of PAH metabolites used as biomarkers of exposure so as to include the analysis of PAH tetrahydroxylated forms (especially those exhibiting more than 5 aromatic rings), the present methodology will enable multi-exposure assessments which are more accurately representative of actual situations of exposure to PAHs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Metabolomics is a key approach in modern functional genomics and systems biology. Due to the complexity of metabolomics data, the variety of experimental designs, and the multiplicity of bioinformatics tools, providing experimenters with a simple and efficient resource to conduct comprehensive and rigorous analysis of their data is of utmost importance. In 2014, we launched the Workflow4Metabolomics (W4M; http://workflow4metabolomics.org) online infrastructure for metabolomics built on the Galaxy environment, which offers user-friendly features to build and run data analysis workflows including preprocessing, statistical analysis, and annotation steps. Here we present the new W4M 3.0 release, which contains twice as many tools as the first version, and provides two features which are, to our knowledge, unique among online resources. First, data from the four major metabolomics technologies (i.e., LC–MS, FIA–MS, GC–MS, and NMR) can be analyzed on a single platform. By using three studies in human physiology, alga evolution, and animal toxicology, we demonstrate how the 40 available tools can be easily combined to address biological issues. Second, the full analysis (including the workflow, the parameter values, the input data and output results) can be referenced with a permanent digital object identifier (DOI). Publication of data analyses is of major importance for robust and reproducible science. Furthermore, the publicly shared workflows are of high-value for e-learning and training. The Workflow4Metabolomics 3.0 e-infrastructure thus not only offers a unique online environment for analysis of data from the main metabolomics technologies, but it is also the first reference repository for metabolomics workflows. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Bisphenol A (BPA) is used in a wide variety of products and objects for consumers use (digital media such as CD's and DVD's, sport equipment, food and beverage containers, medical equipment). For humans, the main route of exposure to BPA is food. Based on previous estimates, almost 20% of the dietary exposure to BPA in the French population would be from food of animal origin. However, due to the use of composite samples, the source of the contamination had not been identified. Therefore, 322 individual samples of non-canned foods of animal origin were collected with the objectives of first updating the estimation of the exposure of the French population and second identifying the source of contamination of these foodstuffs using a specific analytical method. Compared to previous estimates in France, a decline in the contamination of the samples was observed, in particular with regard to meat. The estimated mean dietary exposures ranged from 0.048 to 0.050 μg (kg bw)−1 d−1 for 3–17 year children and adolescents, from 0.034 to 0.035 μg (kg bw)−1 d−1 for adults and from 0.047 to 0.049 μg (kg bw)−1 d−1 for pregnant women. The contribution of meat to total dietary exposure of pregnant women, adults and children was up to three times lower than the previous estimates. Despite this downward trend in contamination, the toxicological values were observed to have been exceeded for the population of pregnant women. With the aim of acquiring more knowledge about the origin the potential source(s) of contamination of non-canned foods of animal origin, a specific analytical method was developed to directly identify and quantify the presence of conjugated BPA (BPA-monoglucuronide, BPA-diglucuronide and sulphate forms) in 50 samples. No conjugated forms of BPAs were detected in the analysed samples, indicating clearly that BPA content in animal food was not due to metabolism but arise post mortem in food. This contamination may occur during food production. However, despite extensive sampling performed in several different shops (butcheries, supermarkets …. ) and in different conditions (fresh, prepared, frozen …), the source(s) of the contamination could not be specifically identified. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Shells fired during World War I exhibited different explosive compounds and some of these weapons also contained a wide variety of chemical warfare agents. At the end of the war, for safety purposes, the large quantity of weapons remaining on the former front needed to be dismantled and destroyed. A large amount of the remaining shells was destroyed in specific sites which led to the contamination of the surroundings in Belgium and France. In the 1920s, 1.5 million chemical shells and 30,000 explosive shells were destroyed in a place close to the city of Verdun, in the East of France. In this paper, the risk for human health related to the consumption of foodstuffs produced on this site was assessed. To this end, food products of plant and animal origin were sampled in 2015–2016 and contaminant analyses were conducted. Human exposure was assessed using a specifically built methodology. The contaminants considered in this study were trace elements (TEs - primarily Zn, As, Pb and Cd), nitroaromatic explosives (trinitrotoluene, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, 2,6-dinitrotoluene, 2-amino-4,6-dinitroluene and 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene), phenylarsenic compounds including diphenylarsinic acid and triphenylarsine, perchlorate, tetrabromoethane and vinyl bromide. Depending on the compound, different approaches were used to assess the risk for both adults and children. Exposure to these contaminants through the consumption of foodstuffs produced locally on the considered site was unlikely to be a health concern. However, as for inorganic arsenic, given the presence of highly contaminated zones, it was suggested that cereals should not be grown on certain plots. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The core food model was described more than three decades ago, and has been used ever since to identify main food contributors to dietary intakes for both nutrients and other food chemicals. The Sub-Saharan Africa Total Diet Study (SSA-TDS) uses this model to describe the food consumption habits of some selected populations of Benin, Cameroon, Mali, and Nigeria, prior to use in the completion of quantitative risk assessments with regard to food chemicals. Food consumption data were derived from food expenditure data contained in national household budget surveys that were provided by the national institutes of statistics in each country. A classification of African foods was established for the purpose of the study and core foods were selected, so as to reflect 96 ± 1% of the average national total diet expressed in weight. Populations from eight study centers were selected by national stakeholders. This approach involves the purchase of 4020 individual foods, prepared as consumed and pooled into 335 food composite samples, for analysis of mycotoxins, PAHs, PCBs and dioxins, pesticides, metals and trace elements, PFAs, and BFRs. This sampling plan aims to provide a representative, cost effective, and replicable approach for deterministic dietary exposure assessments in developing countries. © 2017 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations},

Environmental contaminants (17 polychlorinated dibenzodioxins/dibenzofurans, 18 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 3 hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) isomers, 6 mycotoxins, 6 inorganic compounds) together with chemical residues arising from production inputs (75 antimicrobials, 10 coccidiostats and 121 pesticides) have been selected as relevant compounds. A dedicated sampling strategy, representative of the French production allowed quantification of a large sample set (n = 266) including both conventional (n = 139) and organic (n = 127) raw meat from three animal species (bovine, porcine, poultry). While contamination levels below regulatory limits were measured in all the samples, significant differences were observed between both species and types of farming. Several environmental contaminants (Dioxins, PCBs, HBCD, Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb, As) were measured at significantly higher levels in organic samples. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This work presents the effects of pan cooking on PCBs, PCDD/Fs, pesticides and trace elements in meat from a risk assessment perspective. Three different realistic cooking intensities were studied. A GC×GC-TOF/MS method was set up for the multiresidue analysis of 189 PCBs, 17 PCDD/Fs and 16 pesticides whereas Cd, As, Pb and Hg were assayed by ICP-MS. In terms of quantity, average PCB losses after cooking were 18 ± 5% for rare, 30 ± 3% for medium, and 48 ± 2% for well-done meat. In contrast, average PCDD/F losses were not significant. For pesticides, no loss occurred for aldrin, lindane, DDE or DDD, whereas losses exceeding 80% were found for dieldrin, sulfotep or phorate. Losses close to the margin of error were observed for trace elements. These results are discussed in light of the physicochemical properties of the micropollutants as well as of water and fat losses into cooking juice. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) has recently caught the attention of researchers from different fields including food safety. In general, IMS has been considered as analytical detection tool for the analysis of residues and contaminants in foodstuffs due to its high sensitivity, quick response and portability. However, IMS also provides an extra separation dimension when it is coupled to traditional liquid chromatography or gas chromatography–mass spectrometry methods. Due to the enhancement of the resolving power, target analytes can be easier isolated from chemical background as well as isobaric and isomeric compounds are separated. In addition, collision cross section databases for residues and contaminants have been recently reported. It supposes the first attempt for considering this IMS-related parameter as an additional dimension for chemical structure elucidation in food safety control. This review presents an overview of the current state of IMS in the field and discusses its main perspectives in the area. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Automated annotation of data, originating from liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry profiles (LC–HRMS), remains a highly challenging task. Therefore, the Critical Assessment of Small Molecule Identification (CASMI) Contest (http://casmi-contest.org/) represents a unique opportunity to blindly evaluate annotation workflows. The 2016 CASMI contest consisted of 16 LC–HRMS/MS profiles with 18 detected peaks to annotate. Those peaks corresponded to compounds from natural origin. An R script based on the XCMS, IPO, RMassBank, CAMERA and MeHaloCoA packages was devised. Two other external tools: SIRIUS3 and CFM-ID were also integrated for molecular formulae and in silico fragmentation calculation, respectively. This script was used to perform peak picking, spectral interpretation, molecular formula determination and database search for structural determination. Finally, the structures were further discriminated based on in silico fragmentation. After the release of the CASMI contest solutions, successes and failures of the proposed script were investigated. In most cases, no differences were observed in the rank of the correct structure when using raw LC–HRMS data or manually obtained MS and MS/MS spectra. However, the study of the few cases where differences were detected tends to show that automatic detection of MS2 data within the raw LC–MS data yielded more accurate identification. The failures in proposing the correct structure within the submission list were related to the absence of the right structure in the interrogated databases. However, very close structure were proposed in first rank indicating that such approaches are able to rapidly determine the carbon skeleton of the structure; the medium rank of the correct structure in the proposed list for each peak of interest being 2nd. © 2016},

abstract={The heterotrophic lifestyle of parasitic plants relies on the development of the haustorium, a specifc infectious organ required for attachment to host roots. While haustorium development is initiated upon chemodetection of host-derived molecules in hemiparasitic plants, the induction of haustorium formation remains largely unknown in holoparasitic species such as Phelipanche ramosa. This work demonstrates that the root exudates of the host plant Brassica napus contain allelochemicals displaying haustorium-inducing activity on P. ramosa germinating seeds, which increases the parasite aggressiveness. A de novo assembled transcriptome and microarray approach with P. ramosa during early haustorium formation upon treatment with B. napus root exudates allowed the identifcation of differentially expressed genes involved in hormone signaling. Bioassays using exogenous cytokinins and the specifc cytokinin receptor inhibitor PI-55 showed that cytokinins induced haustorium formation and increased parasite aggressiveness. Root exudates triggered the expression of cytokinin-responsive genes during early haustorium development in germinated seeds, and bio-guided UPLC-ESI(+)-/MS/MS analysis showed that these exudates contain a cytokinin with dihydrozeatin characteristics. These results suggest that cytokinins constitutively exudated from host roots play a major role in haustorium formation and aggressiveness in P. ramosa. © 2017 Author(s).},

abstract={The onset of steroidogenesis in human fetal adrenal glands (HFA) during the first trimester is poorly investigated. An unresolved question is the capacity of the HFA to produce potent androgen DHT via conventional and/or the backdoor pathway(s) at the end of first trimester, when androgen-responsive organs are developed. Our aim was to explore steroidogenesis and the expression of steroidogenic enzymes and transcription factors in HFA at gestational weeks (GW) 9–12 with focus on their androgenic potential. Steroids in the HFA were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The expression of steroidogenic enzymes and transcription factors in the HFA at GW9–12 was investigated by qPCR, automated Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. We demonstrated that during GW9–12 HFA produced steroids of the ∆5, ∆4 and the backdoor pathways of the biosynthesis of DHT, though the latter was limited to production of 17α-OH-dihydroprogesterone, androsterone and androstanedione without further conversion to DHT. The only androgens identified in the HFA were testosterone and androsterone, a precursor in the biosynthesis of DHT. We also observed higher levels of CYP17A1 but low expression of 3βHSD2 at GW11–12 in the HFA. Elevated levels of CYP17A1 were associated with an increased expression of SF-1 and GATA-6. Altogether, our data demonstrate that of those steroids analyzed, the only potent androgen directly produced by the HFA at GW9–12 was testosterone. The onset of steroidogenesis in the HFA is a complex process that is regulated by the coordinated action of related transcription factors. © 2017 The authors Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.},

abstract={Perfluorooctane sulfonamidoethanol based phosphate diester (SAmPAP) is a potential perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) precursor. To examine whether SAmPAP exposure would result in fish contamination by perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), juvenile Eurasian perch were dietarily exposed to this compound (dosed group) or exposed to the same tank water but fed control feed (control group). SAmPAP and metabolites were monitored in the muscle, liver, and serum during the 45-day exposure phase and 35-day depuration phase. SAmPAP was only detected in the dosed group and the absorption efficiency (0.04-2.25%) was very low, possibly related to its low bioavailability in the gastrointestinal tract, steric constraints in crossing biological membranes, and clearing by enterohepatic circulation. Although SAmPAP was biotransformed and eliminated at a slow rate (t1/2 &gt; 18 days), its biomagnification factor was low. The observed metabolites in fish were N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid, perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid, perfluorooctane sulfonamide, and PFOS. Considering that SAmPAP was the only source of PFASs in the tanks, the occurrence of metabolites indicates that SAmPAP could be biotransformed in fish and contribute to PFOS bioaccumulation. However, levels of metabolites were not significantly different in the dosed and control groups, indicating that metabolite excretion followed by re-exposure to these metabolites from water was the main uptake route. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Besides their development for therapeutic purposes, non-steroidal selective androgen receptor modulators (non-steroidal SARMs) are also known to impact growth-associated pathways as ligands of androgenic receptors (AR). They present a potential for abuse in sports and food-producing animals as an interesting alternative to anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS). These compounds are easily available and could therefore be (mis)used in livestock production as growth promoters. To prevent such practices, dedicated analytical strategies should be developed for specific and sensitive detection of these compounds in biological matrices. The present study focused on Bicalutamide, a non-steroidal SARM used in human treatment of non-metastatic prostate cancer because of its anti-androgenic activity exhibiting no anti-anabolic effects. To select the most appropriate matrix to be used for control purposes, different animal matrices (urine and faeces) have been investigated and SARM metabolism studied to highlight relevant metabolites of such treatments and establish associated detection time windows. The aim of this work was thus to compare the urinary and faecal eliminations of bicalutamide in a calf, and investigate phase I and II metabolites. The results in both matrices showed that bicalutamide was very rapidly and mainly excreted under its free form. The concentration levels were observed as higher in faeces (ppm) than urine (ppb); although both matrices were assessed as suitable for residue control. The metabolites found were consistent with hydroxylation (phase I reaction) combined or not with glucuronidation and sulfation (phase II reactions). Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

abstract={Introduction: The surveillance of illegal anabolic practices in bovine meat production is necessary to guarantee consumers’ health. Screening strategies based on the recognition of indirect biological effects are considered by the community as promising tools to overcome some limitations of classical analytical methods and might therefore concur to ensure safer food for the consumer. Objectives: The present work aims at characterizing the metabolic profile induced in liver by administration of anabolic steroids, and at identifying potential disturbances in the hepatic metabolism. Methods: A total of 32 liver samples, 16 from untreated bulls and 16 from bulls treated with an ear implant (Revalor-XS®) containing trenbolone acetate (200 mg) and β-estradiol (40 mg), were analyzed following a LC–MS-based metabolomic analysis combining RP and HILIC chromatographic separations. Different multivariate statistical tools were applied to the datasets to select common metabolites that may be considered as potential markers based on their significant changes in concentrations after administration of sexual steroids. Results: Eight candidate markers were identified. Moreover, a subset of four markers was also validated by a different laboratory that performed the same analysis using an independent instrumental and elaboration platform, confirming the robustness of the results achieved. Conclusion: This study was performed mimicking experimental conditions that may be used during a potential misuse practice. It is promising in the objective of setting up an analytical strategy to highlight sexual steroids abuse in livestock animals. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={STUDY QUESTION Are bisphenol A (BPA) and BPA analogs (BPA-A) safe for male human reproductive function? SUMMARY ANSWER The endocrine function of human testes explants [assessed by measuring testosterone and insulin-like factor 3 (INSL3)] was impacted by exposure of the human adult testis explants to BPA/BPA-A. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY The few epidemiologic studies performed suggest that bisphenols have potential endocrine disruptive properties, but they did not identify clear and direct patterns of endocrine disruption. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Adult human testis explants in culture were exposed to BPA and the analogs bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol E (BPE), bisphenol B (BPB) and bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) at 10 '9 -10 '5 M for 24 or 48 h. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Human adult testes were obtained from prostate cancer patients who had no hormone therapy, or from multiorgan donors. After ex vivo exposure to the investigated bisphenols, the measured outcomes were related to histopathology (gross morphology and germ cell viability determined by anti-caspase three immunohistochemistry), and the levels of testosterone, INSL3 and inhibin B were measured using immunoassays. The levels of mRNA encoding key enzymes of bisphenol biotransformation were investigated by quantitative PCR: UGT2B15 UDP (glucuronosyltransferase two family, polypeptide B15), GUSB (glucuronidase beta), SULT1A1 and 3 (sulfotransferase family 1 A member 1 and 3) and STS (steroid sulfatase). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE A significant dose-dependent inhibition was found between testosterone levels measured in the culture medium and concentrations of BPA (P = 0.00778 at 24 h and P = 0.0291 at 48 h), BPE (P = 0.039) and BPF (P = 0.00663). The observed BPA and BPA-A-induced inhibition of testosterone production varied according to duration of exposure and BPA/BPA-A concentrations. BPA (10 '9 M; P < 0.05), BPB (10 '9 M; P < 0.05), BPS (10 '9 and 10 '8 M; P < 0.05) and BADGE (10 '5 M; P < 0.05) increased Leydig cell INSL3 production. By contrast, BPE dose dependently inhibited INSL3 (P = 0.0372). Conversely, Sertoli cell function (inhibin B) and germ cell viability were not significantly affected by either bisphenols. LARGE SCALE DATA N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Environmental compounds cannot be deliberately administered to men, justifying the use of an ex vivo approach. A relatively low number of testes samples were available for analysis (n = 3, except for testosterone secretion with n = 5). The active concentrations of BPA and BPA-A used in the study were higher than those found in human biological fluids. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Under our experimental conditions, direct exposure to BPA or BPA-A can result in endocrine disturbance in the adult human testis.

abstract={Introduction: Ractopamine, a β-agonist used as growth promoter in livestock, is with great controversy, and it has been forbidden in most countries worldwide. However, due to economic benefits, the possibility of widespread abuse of ractopamine still exists. “Omics” strategies, based on the observation of physiological perturbations, are promising approaches to tackle drug misuse in breeding animals. Objectives: A study was performed to determine if serum-metabolomics could be used to establish a predictive tool for identifying ractopamine misuse in pigs. Methods: Our aim was to set up a high performance liquid chromatography—high resolution mass spectrometry based metabolomics workflow for screening pig serum for ractopamine administration. Therefore, an untargeted metabolomics approach was developed to characterize and compare serum metabolic profiles from control and treated pigs. Two different extraction strategies were investigated, and the results showed that the combination of methanol extraction and methanol–water extraction protocols significantly improve the metabolites coverage. A two-level data analysis using univariate and multivariate statistical analyses was carried out to establish descriptive and predictive models. Results: The discrimination of treated animals from control animals could be achieved. A number of candidate biomarkers that contributed the most in the observed discrimination could be listed. Conclusion: This research indicates that metabolomics approach can be considered as a powerful strategy to highlight biomarkers related to ractopamine treatment in pig which may subsequently be implemented as screening strategy to predict for such illicit practices. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Starting from a critical analysis of a first “proof of concept” study on the utility of the liver volatolome for detecting livestock exposure to environmental micropollutants (Berge et al., 2011), the primary aim of this paper is to improve extraction conditions so as to obtain more representative extracts by using an extraction temperature closer to livestock physiological conditions while minimizing analytical variability and maximizing Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) abundancies. Levers related to extraction conditions and sample preparation were assessed in the light of both abundance and coefficient of variation of 22 candidate VOC markers identified in earlier volatolomic studies. Starting with a CAR/PDMS fiber and a 30 min extraction, the reduction of SPME temperature to 40 °C resulted in a significant decrease in the area of 14 candidate VOC markers (p < 0.05), mainly carbonyls and alcohols but also a reduction in the coefficient of variation for 17 of them. In order to restore VOC abundances and to minimize variability, two approaches dealing with sample preparation were investigated. By increasing sample defrosting time at 4 °C from 0 to 24 h yielded higher abundances and lower variabilities for 15 and 13 compounds, respectively. Lastly, by using additives favouring the release of VOCs (1.2 g of NaCl) the sensitivity of the analysis was improved with a significant increase in VOC abundances of more than 50% for 13 out of the 22 candidate markers. The modified SPME parameters significantly enhanced the abundances while decreasing the analytical variability for most candidate VOC markers. The second step was to validate the ability of the revised SPME protocol to discriminate intentionally contaminated broiler chickens from controls, under case/control animal testing conditions. After verification of the contamination levels of the animals by national reference laboratories, data analysis by a multivariate chemometric method (Common Components and Specific Weights Analysis − ComDim) showed that the liver volatolome could reveal dietary exposure of broilers to a group of environmental pollutants (PCBs), a veterinary treatment (monensin), and a pesticide (deltamethrin), thus confirming the usefulness of this analytical set-up. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are a novel class of androgen receptor ligands. They are intended to exhibit the same kind of effects as androgenic drugs, like anabolic steroids, but be much more selective in their action, targeting particular tissues without any undesirable effects on others. While the main applications of these synthetic substances are for therapeutic purposes, they also have a high potential for misuse in veterinary practice and the sporting world. In order to guarantee for consumers with food from animal origin that it is free from any residues of such compounds, analytical strategies are required to ensure safe food and also to enable fair trade between producers. In this context an animal experiment involving bovines administered with enobosarm was conducted to provide the study with biological matrices. Different animal matrices (urine and faeces) were investigated to select the most appropriate matrix for use for control purposes, in terms of metabolite relevance and detection time window. Based on ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) this work highlighted the presence of sulfonated and glucuronated-conjugated forms of the molecule in the urine of treated animals. Enobosarm could be detected in urine up to 9 days after the administration when samples underwent phase II hydrolysis. Faeces was demonstrated to be the main matrix of excretion of enobosarm since values up to 500 times higher compared with urine could be detected for 21 days. There was no difference between the kinetic profiles when a deconjugation step was or was not was applied. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Among pregnant women ibuprofen is one of the most frequently used pharmaceutical compounds with up to 28% reporting use. Regardless of this, it remains unknown whether ibuprofen could act as an endocrine disruptor as reported for fellow analgesics paracetamol and aspirin. To investigate this, we exposed human fetal testes (7-17 gestational weeks (GW)) to ibuprofen using ex vivo culture and xenograft systems. Ibuprofen suppressed testosterone and Leydig cell hormone INSL3 during culture of 8-9 GW fetal testes with concomitant reduction in expression of the steroidogenic enzymes CYP11A1, CYP17A1 and HSD17B3, and of INSL3. Testosterone was not suppressed in testes from fetuses younger than 8 GW, older than 10-12 GW, or in second trimester xenografted testes (14-17 GW). Ex vivo, ibuprofen also affected Sertoli cell by suppressing AMH production and mRNA expression of AMH, SOX9, DHH, and COL2A1. While PGE2 production was suppressed by ibuprofen, PGD2 production was not. Germ cell transcripts POU5F1, TFAP2C, LIN28A, ALPP and KIT were also reduced by ibuprofen. We conclude that, at concentrations relevant to human exposure and within a particular narrow â €' early window' of sensitivity within first trimester, ibuprofen causes direct endocrine disturbances in the human fetal testis and alteration of the germ cell biology. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Currently under development for therapeutic purposes in human medicine, non-steroidal selective androgen receptor modulators (non-steroidal SARMs) are also known to impact growth associated pathways. As such, they present a potential for abuse in sports and food-producing animals as interesting alternative anabolic substances. Forbidden since 2008 by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) these compounds are however easily available and could be (mis)used in livestock production as growth promoters. To prevent such practices, dedicated analytical strategies have to be developed for specific and sensitive detection of these compounds in biological matrices. Using an innovative analytical platform constituted of supercritical fluid chromatography coupled to ion mobility-mass spectrometry, the present study enabled efficient separation and identification in urine of 4 of these drugs (andarine, bicalutamide, hydroxyflutamide, and enobosarm) in accordance with European Union criteria (Commission Decision 2002/657/EC). Besides providing information about compounds structure and behaviour in gas phase, such a coupling enabled reaching low limits of detection (LOD &lt; 0.05 ng.mL−1 for andarine and limits of detection &lt; 0.005 ng.mL−1 for the three others) in urine with good repeatability (CV &lt; 21 %).

abstract={Scope: Resveratrol has a diverse array of healthful effects on metabolic parameters in different experimental paradigms but has also potential to inhibit steroidogenesis in rodent adrenals. The aim of the present study was to characterize the effects of resveratrol on human fetal adrenal steroidogenesis at gestational weeks (GW) 9–12. Methods and results: Adrenals from aborted fetuses (GW10-12) were used to prepare primary cultures of human fetal adrenocortical cells (HFAC). HFAC were treated in the presence or absence of ACTH (10 ng/mL) with or without resveratrol (10 μM) for 24 h. The production of steroids by HFAC was analyzed by gas and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem/mass spectrometry. The expression of steroidogenic enzymes at GW 9–12 was quantified by automated Western blotting. We observed that resveratrol significantly suppressed synthesis of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenedione and 11-deoxicortisol by ACTH-activated and unstimulated HFAC, which was associated with inhibition of the activities and expression of cytochromes 17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase (CYP17) and 21-hydroxylase (CYP21) in these fetal adrenocortical cells. Conclusion: Our in vitro findings on the sensitivity of human fetal adrenal steroidogenesis to resveratrol at GW9-12 suggest that intake of this polyphenol at high doses by women who are at early stages of pregnancy is undesirable. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={Boar taint is an offensive odour that can occur while cooking pork or pork products and is identified in some uncastrated male pigs that have reached puberty. It is widely held that boar taint is the result of the accumulation in back fat of two malodorous compounds: androstenone and skatole. The purpose of this study is to assess a mass spectrometry-based metabolomics strategy to investigate the metabolic profile of urine samples from pig carcasses presenting low (untainted) and high (tainted) levels of androstenone and skatole in back fat. Urine samples were analysed by LC-ESI(+)-HRMS. Discrimination between tainted and untainted animals was observed by the application of multivariate statistical analysis, which allowed candidate urinary biomarkers to be highlighted. These urinary metabolites were positively correlated to androstenone and skatole levels in back fat. Therefore, the study suggests that the measurement of these urinary metabolites might provide information with regard to androstenone and skatole levels in live pigs. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Both HILIC and RP chromatographies have been implemented in order to globally monitor the urinary metabolome. Using an original data processing associated to univariate and multivariate data analysis, our study confirms that chemical profiles of urine samples stored at +4 °C are very rapidly modified, as observed for instance for compounds such as:N-acetyl Glycine, Adenosine, 4-Amino benzoic acid, N-Amino diglycine, creatine, glucuronic acid, 3-hydroxy-benzoic acid, pyridoxal, L-pyroglutamic acid, shikimic acid, succinic acid, thymidine, trigonelline and valeryl-carnitine, while it also demonstrates that urine samples stored at −20 °C exhibit a global stability over a long period with no major modifications compared to −80 °C condition. This study is the first to investigate long term stability of urine samples and report potential modifications in the urinary metabolome, using both targeted approach monitoring individually a large number (n > 200) of urinary metabolites and an untargeted strategy enabling assessing for global impact of storage conditions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Endometriosis is a gynaecological disease characterized by the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue. Histologically, it appears as different sub-types, being peritoneal endometriosis, ovarian endometrioma (OvE) and deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), which are of major relevance due to their varying clinical presentations. A number of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been associated with the onset of endometriosis, yet the overall set of existing studies remains fairly divergent. In this preliminary case-control study we aimed to assess the potential associations between the internal exposure to POPs and the presence of DIE with or without concurrent OvE. Adipose tissue and serum samples were collected from surgically confirmed cases (n = 55) and controls (n = 44) enrolled during 2013 and 2015 in Pays de la Loire, France. Targeted pollutants (76 historical or more emerging POPs including dioxins, polychlorobiphenyls (PCB), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were quantified by chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from unconditional logistic regression adjusted for known confounding variables. The results showed significant associations between DIE and adipose tissue levels of 1.2.3.7.8 – PeCDD, OCDF, PCB 105, 114, 118 and 123, PBDE 183, PBB 153, and several OCPs including trans‑nonachlor, cis‑heptachlor epoxide, dieldrin, β-hexachlorocyclohexane and hexachlorobenzene. The largest associations were observed for OCDF followed by cis‑heptachlor epoxide, exhibiting adjusted ORs (95% CI) of 5.42 (2.73–12.85) and 5.36 (2.44–14.84) per 1-SD increase, respectively. The stratified analysis comparing both disease sub-types suggested that adipose tissue exposure markers may be more associated with DIE concurrent with OvE, however these results need to be confirmed in a larger population. © 2017},

abstract={Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are chemical compounds incorporated into materials as flame-proof and/or plasticizing agents. In this work, 13 non-halogenated and 5 halogenated OPEs were studied. Their mass spectra were interpreted and compared in terms of fragmentation patterns and dominant ions via various ionization techniques [electron ionization (EI) and chemical ionization (CI) under vacuum and corona discharge atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI)] on gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The novelty of this paper relies on the investigation of APCI technique for the analysis of OPEs via favored protonation mechanism, where the mass spectra were mostly dominated by the quasi-molecular ion [M + H]+. The EI mass spectra were dominated by ions such as [H4PO4]+, [M–R]+, [M–Cl]+, and [M–Br]+, and for some non-halogenated aryl OPEs, [M]+● was also observed. The CI mass spectra in positive mode were dominated by [M + H]+ and sometimes by [M–R]+, while in negative mode, [M–R]− and more particularly [X]- and [X2]-● were mainly observed for the halogenated OPEs. Both EI and APCI techniques showed promising results for further development of instrumental method operating in selective reaction monitoring mode. Instrumental detection limits by using APCI mode were 2.5 to 25 times lower than using EI mode for the non-brominated OPEs, while they were determined at 50-100 times lower by the APCI mode than by the EI mode, for the two brominated OPEs. The method was applied to fish samples, and monitored transitions by using APCI mode showed higher specificity but lower stability compared with EI mode.

abstract={Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) is a critical emerging brominated flame retardant to which consumers can be exposed at high doses through a single food intake. Based on an animal experiment involving 3 groups of laying hens fed during 70 days with a control diet or γ-HBCD-contaminated diets at 0.1 or 10 μg γ-HBCD g−1 feed, this study aims to use the volatolome of biological samples for revealing markers of livestock exposure to HBCD. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry was used to monitor the time-course of HBCD levels in bodily samples. Each liver was analyzed by solid-phase microextraction–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry for volatolome profiling. After 70 days, γ-HBCD concentrations in egg yolk, fat, liver and serum reached 54 ± 4, 85 ± 6, 31 ± 6, and 32 ± 4 ng g−1 lw, respectively, for the low exposure level and 4.6+/5.7, 7.8+/6.5, 3.9+/3.0 and 3.9+/6.1 μg g−1 lw, respectively, for the high exposure level. Isomerization of γ-HBCD into α- and β-HBCD was observed in all tissues, at least for the high exposure level. Volatolome data allowed a significant discrimination between control and exposed animals whatever the feed contamination load, demonstrating a liver metabolic response to γ-HBCD exposure. The relevance of the twenty nine volatile exposure markers tentatively identified was discussed in light of literature data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The aim of the current study was to describe the fate of ingested α-hexabromocyclododecane (α-HBCDD) in fast-growing (FG) and slow-growing (SG) broilers, through an exposure to a dietary concentration of 50 ng α-HBCDD g−1 feed during 42 and 84 days, respectively. Depuration parameters were assessed in SG broilers successively exposed during 42 days and depurated during 42 days. At market age, SG broilers had ingested 42% more feed than FG broilers, while their body weight gain per g of feed ingested was 34% lower. No isomerization of α- to β- or γ-HBCDD forms occurred, while OH-HBCDD was identified as a product of α-HBCDD metabolism. Irrespective of the strain, abdominal fat displayed the highest α-HBCDD concentration on a lipid weight basis, followed leg muscles and then breast muscle, liver and plasma. The accumulation ratios of α-HBCDD were slightly higher in SG (6.7, 2.1, 2.6 and 9.9 in leg muscles, breast muscle, liver and abdominal fat, respectively) than in FG broilers (5.2, 2.2, 1.1 and 8.4, respectively). The elimination half-lives in SG broilers were 20, 12 and 19 d in leg muscles, breast muscle and abdominal fat, respectively, to which dilution through growth contributed for around 50%. The overall assimilation efficiency of α-HBCDD was estimated at 58 and 50% in FG and SG broilers, respectively, while 22 and 17% of α-HBCDD ingested were estimated to be eliminated in excreta as metabolites. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The overall concentration of hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) in eggs is low although abnormally high concentrations exceeding 3000 ng g−1 lw have been reported. In order to test whether these contaminations may originate from the ingestion of insulating materials in rearing buildings, a group of 55 hens raised in a collective cage was provided with a 64-g piece of extruded polystyrene (XPS, 2.59% HBCDD of which 75, 15 and 10% as α-, β- and γ-HBCDD, respectively). Hens entirely consumed the piece within 3 days, leading to a mean daily exposure of 4.7 mg HBCDD per kg body weight. Whole egg HBCDD concentration reached a maximum of 1037 ng HBCDD g−1 fresh weight (fw), recorded 2 days after the piece had disappeared, and decreased down to 86 ng g−1 fw within the 19 following days. In all these samples, HBCDD was made of 98.7 ± 0.7 and 1.3 ± 0.6% α- and β-HBCDD, respectively, and 0.1% γ-HBCDD when quantified; it was enriched in (−)α- and (+)β-HBCDD with enantiomeric fractions of 0.438 ± 0.009 and 0.579 ± 0.030, respectively. HBCDD was quantified in all the individual eggs collected the last day of experiment at concentrations ranging between 0.47 and 1361 ng g−1 fw, according to a lognormal distribution. The ingestion of XPS in degraded rearing buildings is thus a plausible cause of on-farm egg contamination by HBCDD which should be strictly avoided. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A LC-ESI(−)-HRMS method dedicated to the analysis of 6 HBCDD enantiomers at trace levels in animal matrices was developed, using a cellulose based stationary phase with a particle size of 2.5ï¿½μm. This method was applied to a sample set derived from a kinetic study of α-HBCDD previously conducted in fast- and slow-growing chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus, nï¿½=ï¿½49, plus controls), in order to study the enantiomer specific accumulation and depuration of α-HBCDD in various tissues. Regarding abdominal adipose tissue, muscle and liver, the average enantiomeric fractions of α-HBCDD (EFα) for continuously exposed groups ranged between 0.434 and 0.467, with standard deviations below 0.014, showing a significant enrichment in (−)α enantiomer even accentuated for slow growing individuals during depuration with EFα reduced by about 0.020. Similar trends were observed for pooled plasma. Then, EFα of circulating plasma α-HBCDD appeared to closely reflect EFα in storage tissues and liver, suggesting some equilibrium. The racemic elimination of α enantiomer in excreta during the contamination phase indicated that no preferential gastrointestinal absorption took place. By contrast, preferential excretion of (−)α-HBCDD from the circulating compartment to the intestinal lumen occurred during the depuration. Finally, the method was applied to samples collected in three chicken farms, selected for total HBCDD levels in muscle in the ng/g range, as a tool to determine whether the contamination occurred ante- or post-mortem, according to the chiral signature. Ante-mortem contamination was hypothesised for 2 farms, with feed being excluded as contamination source. ï¿½ 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Several studies have assessed the potential role of environmental chemicals in the onset, growth, and/or physiopathology of endometriosis. However, their contour in terms of considered exposure markers remains limited. The present study aimed to characterize the internal exposure levels of 78 persistent organic pollutants (POPs, including dioxins, polychlorobiphenyls, brominated flame retardants and organochlorine pesticides) in a set of 113 adult French women (45 controls, 68 cases), and to characterize the distribution of these POPs within three biological compartments (omental adipose tissue, parietal adipose tissue, and serum). For all targeted substances, the correlation between the concentrations measured in omental versus parietal adipose tissue was found strongly significant (p &lt; 0.0001). An equivalence of the measures performed in parietal and omental adipose tissue was moreover observed with median levels of 6.4 vs. 7.4 pg/g l.w. for WHO-TEQ2005 PCDD/F, 4.5 vs. 4.7 pg/g l.w. for WHO-TEQ2005 dl-PCB, 137.1 vs. 147.9 ng/g l.w. for sum of 6 ndl-PCB, and 2.1 vs. 2.0 ng/g l.w. for sum of 7 i-PBDE, respectively. The same observation was made for individual targeted OCs compounds. Significant correlations were also observed between these concentrations determined in adipose tissue and those measured in serum for dioxins (WHO-TEQ2005 PCDD/F = 6.1 pg/g l.w), PCBs (WHO-TEQ2005 dl-PCB = 3.6 pg/g l.w., sum of 6 ndl-PCB = 81.1 ng/g l.w.), and brominated flame-retardants (sum of 7 i-PBDE = 0.9 ng/g l.w.). The circulating versus stored ratio of some exposure markers (Sum PCDDs, 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDF, slightly versus highly chlorinated PCBs ratio, PBDE 99 and PBB 153) was found statistically different for control and case individuals. These extended exposure data from deep infiltrating endometriosis patients are the first ones available for France and give a new insight about the equilibrium of chemicals between storage and circulating compartments that should be further considered as new marker of exposure in the context of exposure-health relationship studies. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The present study compares concentrations and chemical profiles of an extended range of persistent organic pollutants (dioxins, polychlorobiphenyls, brominated flame retardants and organochlorine pesticides) in breast milk samples from French (n = 96), Danish (n = 438) and Finnish (n = 22) women. Median exposure levels observed in French women (WHO-TEQ2005 PCDD/F = 6.1 pg/g l.w., WHO-TEQ2005 dl-PCB = 4.3 pg/g l.w., sum of 6 ndl-PCB = 85.2 ng/g l.w., sum of 7 i-PBDE = 1.5 ng/g l.w.) appeared overall lower than in Danish and Finnish women for all examined POPs, except for α-HBCD (2-fold higher level at 0.6 ng/g l.w.). Furthermore, the observed exposure levels of dioxins and PCBs were higher in Danish women (WHO-TEQ2005 PCDD/F = 13.2 pg/g l.w., WHO-TEQ2005 dl-PCB = 6.6 pg/g l.w., sum of 6 ndl-PCB = 162.8 ng/g l.w.) compared to Finnish women (WHO-TEQ2005 PCDD/F = 9.0 pg/g l.w., WHO-TEQ2005 dl-PCB = 4.6 pg/g l.w., sum of 6 ndl-PCB = 104.0 ng/g l.w.), whereas the concentrations of PBDEs were similar for Danish and Finnish women (sum of 7 i-PBDE = 4.9 and 5.2 ng/g l.w. respectively). The organochlorine (OC) pesticide contamination profile, determined in a subset of French samples, was dominated by p,p’-DDE (56.6%), followed by β-HCH (14.2%), HCB (9.7%) and dieldrin (5.2%), while other compounds were only minor contributors (&lt;5%). The three countries appeared to be discriminated by the observed contamination patterns of the PCDD/F versus PCB, and the 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD versus 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDD ratios, in addition to the relative contributions of specific congeners to the contamination profile (PCBs #118 and #156, PBDEs #28, #47, #99 and #153). In conclusion, unique chemical signatures were observed for each country on the basis of some POP congeners. Future biomonitoring studies will need to consider the high variability of individual exposure profiles in relation to multiple exposure sources but also physiological and metabolic differences. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Humans are significantly exposed to phthalates via food packaging, cosmetics and medical devices such as tubings and catheters. Testicular Leydig cells (LCs) are suggested to be among the main targets of phthalate toxicity in the body. However, their sensitivity to phthalates is species-dependent. This paper describes the response of the LCs from different species (mouse, rat and human) to phthalate exposure in different experimental paradigms (in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro), with particular focus on mechanisms of phthalate action on LC steroidogenesis. A comprehensive analysis of the impact of phthalate diesters and phthalate monoesters on LCs in different stages of their development is presented and possible mechanisms of phthalates action are discussed. Finally novel, not yet fully elucidated sites of action of phthalate monoesters on the backdoor pathway of 5α-dihydrotestosterone biosynthesis in immature mouse LCs and their effects on steroidogenesis and redox state in adult mouse LCs are reported. © 2015 S.

abstract={A collection of culture extracts obtained from several marine-derived fungal strains collected on the French Atlantic coast was investigated by high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS) in order to prospect for halogenated compounds and to identify potentially new ones. To achieve a fast, automated, and efficient data analysis, a bioinformatics tool named MeHaloCoA (Marine Halogenated Compound Analysis) was developed and included into R. After extraction of all the peaks from the metabolic fingerprints and their associated mass spectra, a mathematical filter based on mass isotopic profiles allowed the selective detection of halogenated (Cl and Br) molecules. Integrating MeHaloCoA into a dereplication approach allowed the identification of known and new halogenated compounds in a competitive amount of time. Subsequent targeted purification led to the isolation of several chlorinated metabolites, including two new natural products with bioactive potential, griseophenone I and chlorogriseofulvin, from a marine-derived Penicillium canescens strain. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={In the present work, we addressed the question of global seeking/screening organohalogenated compounds in a large panel of complex biological matrices, with a particular focus on unknown chemicals that may be considered as potential emerging hazards. A fishing strategy was developed based on untargeted profiling among full scan acquisition datasets provided by high resolution mass spectrometry. Since large datasets arise from such profiling, filtering useful information stands as a central question. In this way, we took advantage of the exact mass differences between Cl and Br isotopes. Indeed, our workflow involved an innovative Visual Basic for Applications script aiming at pairing features according to this mass difference, in order to point out potential organohalogenated clusters, preceded by an automated peak picking step based on the centWave function (xcms package of open access R programming environment). Then, H/Cl-scale mass defect plots were used to visualize the datasets before and after filtering. The filtering script was successfully applied to a dataset generated upon liquid chromatography coupled to ESI(−)-HRMS measurement from one eel muscle extract, allowing for realistic manual investigations of filtered clusters. Starting from 9789 initial obtained features, 1994 features were paired in 589 clusters. Hexabromocyclododecane, chlorinated paraffin series and various other compounds have been identified or tentatively identified, allowing thus broad screening of organohalogenated compounds in this extract. Although realistic, manual review of paired clusters remains time consuming and much effort should be devoted to automation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Marine ecosystems are constantly being threatened by contaminants produced by human activities. There is an urge to better understand their impacts on marine organisms and develop reliable tools for biomonitoring studies, while also assessing their potential impacts on human health. Given their position on top of food webs, sharks are particularly susceptible to bioaccumulation, making them potential sentinel species of marine contamination. The main objective of this study was to find suitable biomarkers for future marine pollution biomonitoring studies by correlating biochemical responses with tissue contaminant body burden in blue sharks (Prionace glauca), a species heavily caught and consumed by humans, while also addressing their general health. The chemical contaminants analysed comprised different persistent organic pollutants (POPs) families from polychlorinated compounds to brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and different trace and heavy metals. Concentrations of some contaminants in sharks' tissues were found to be above the legally allowed limits for human consumption. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed and some strong associations were found between biochemical responses and contaminants' accumulation levels. DNA damage and lipid peroxidation levels, as well as the inhibition of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase, were the main effects and consequences of contamination. The impact of contamination on these vital macromolecules underlines the suboptimal conditions of the sampled P. glauca, which can ultimately lead to the degradation of core ecological aspects, such as swimming, feeding, and reproduction. It can be concluded that P. glauca demonstrates great potential to be used as environmental sentinel and suitable biomarker candidates were identified in this work. Moreover, this study also highlights the risks that the consumption of blue shark derived products can pose to human health, which is of upmost interest as the sampled organisms were still juveniles and already presented values above regulatory limits. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

The developed analytical method has decreased the run time by three compared to conventional strategies, using a 2.5 m column length (5% phenyl stationary phase, 0.1 mm i.d., 0.1 μm f.t.), a pulsed split injection (1:5) with carrier gas helium flow rate at 0.48 mL min−1 in one run of 20 min. For most BFRs, analytical data were compared with the current analytical strategy relying on GC/EI/HRMS (double sector, R = 10000 at 10% valley). Performances in terms of sensitivity were found to meet the Commission recommendation (118/2014/EC) for nBFRs. GC/APCI/MS/MS represents a promising alternative for multi-BFRs analysis in complex matrices, in that it allows the monitoring of a wider list of contaminants in a single injection and a shorter run time. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This work aimed at studying metabolome variations of marine fungal strains along their growth to highlight the importance of the parameter "time" for new natural products discovery. An untargeted time-scale metabolomic study has been performed on two different marine-derived Penicillium strains. They were cultivated for 18 days and their crude extracts were analyzed by HPLC-DAD-HRMS (High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Diode Array Detector-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry) each day. With the example of griseofulvin biosynthesis, a pathway shared by both strains, this work provides a new approach to study biosynthetic pathway regulations, which could be applied to other metabolites and more particularly new ones. Moreover, the results of this study emphasize the interest of such an approach for the discovery of new chemical entities. In particular, at every harvesting time, previously undetected features were observed in the LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) data. Therefore, harvesting times for metabolite extraction should be performed at different time points to access the hidden metabolome. © 2016 by the authors.},

abstract={In teleost fish, thyroid function is involved in various critical physiological processes. Given the complexity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, a large number of genes and proteins can be the potential target of endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs). The aim of this study was to evaluate, in yellow and silver European eels (Anguilla anguilla), potential effects of EDCs on thyroid status by analyzing the associations between EDC body burdens and thyroid hormones (THs). In yellow individuals, greater free T3/T4 ratios (FT3/FT4) and lower plasma FT4 levels were associated with greater concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), as highlighted by significant correlations with many congeners. Few positive relationships with alkylphenols were noticed. In contrast, silver eels usually exhibited less significant correlations between THs and contaminant loads. Expression of a series of genes involved in the HPT axis was also investigated in the silver individuals. Concerning mRNA expression in silver females, some main correlations were noticed: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSHβ) gene expression was significantly correlated to numerous PCBs, and hepatic mRNA levels of deiodinase 2 (Deio 2) were negatively correlated to 2-hydroxyfluorene (2-OHF) and 2-naphtol (2-OHNa). Thyroid receptor (TRα and TRβ) mRNA levels exhibited weak negative correlations with some PBDEs in silver females and males. Hepatic vitellogenin (Vtg) mRNA levels were detected in all silver males but at lower levels than in silver females. In males, Vtg mRNA levels were positively associated to FT4/TT4. In silver females, strong positive correlations were found between congeners of PCBs, PBDEs and PFAS suggesting potential estrogenic effects. Overall, the observed results indicate that several organic contaminants, mainly dl-, ndl-PCBs and PBDEs, could be associated with changes in thyroid homeostasis in these fish, via direct or indirect interactions with peripheral deiodination, metabolism of T4 and mechanisms involved in TSHβ, Deio 2 and Vtg gene transcription. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Listeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic Gram positive bacterium and the etiologic agent of listeriosis, a severe food-borne disease. Lactococcus piscium CNCM I-4031 has the capacity to prevent the growth of L. monocytogenes in contaminated peeled and cooked shrimp. To investigate the inhibititory mechanism, a chemically defined medium (MSMA) based on shrimp composition and reproducing the inhibition observed in shrimp was developed. In co-culture at 26 °C, L. monocytogenes was reduced by 3-4 log CFU g-1 after 24 h. We have demonstrated that the inhibition was not due to secretion of extracellular antimicrobial compounds as bacteriocins, organic acids and hydrogen peroxide. Global metabolomic fingerprints of these strains in pure culture were assessed by liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry. Consumption of glucose, amino-acids, vitamins, nitrogen bases, iron and magnesium was measured and competition for some molecules could be hypothesized. However, after 24 h of co-culture, when inhibition of L. monocytogenes occurred, supplementation of the medium with these compounds did not restore its growth. The inhibition was observed in co-culture but not in diffusion chamber when species were separated by a filter membrane. Taken together, these data indicate that the inhibition mechanism of L. monocytogenes by L. piscium is cell-to-cell contact-dependent. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The quantification of the overall health impact of different infant feeding strategies requires an integrated Risk-Benefit Assessment (RBA), including different consumption scenarios and chemical, microbiological and nutritional components of food. In this comprehensive approach, the intra-populational variability must be taken into account to capture all the potential individual health impacts. Uncertainty appears as a second parameter that must also be considered and characterised to interpret better the outputs, to select whether there are significant differences between scenarios and/or to identify a need for more data. To progress further on the RBA methodology, a probabilistic second order model was developed and applied to the assessment of breast milk and infant formula feeding strategies. The first model focused on factors known to cause health effects for each field, namely Cronobacter sakazakii for microbiology, dioxin-like polychlorobiphenyls for chemistry and docosahexaenoic and arachidonic acids for nutrition. The overall health impact has been estimated through second order Monde Carlo simulation for a set of five scenarios of consumption.},

abstract={In cheese, lactic acid bacteria are immobilized at the coagulation step and grow as colonies. The spatial distribution of bacterial colonies is characterized by the size and number of colonies for a given bacterial population within cheese. Our objective was to demonstrate that different spatial distributions, which lead to differences in the exchange surface between the colonies and the cheese matrix, can influence the ripening process. The strategy was to generate cheeses with the same growth and acidification of a Lactococcus lactis strain with two different spatial distributions, big and small colonies, to monitor the production of the major ripening metabolites, including sugars, organic acids, peptides, free amino acids, and volatile metabolites, over 1 month of ripening. The monitored metabolites were qualitatively the same for both cheeses, but many of them were more abundant in the small-colony cheeses than in the big-colony cheeses over 1 month of ripening. Therefore, the results obtained showed that two different spatial distributions of L. lactis modulated the ripening time course by generating moderate but significant differences in the rates of production or consumption for many of the metabolites commonly monitored throughout ripening. The present work further explores the immobilization of bacteria as colonies within cheese and highlights the consequences of this immobilization on cheese ripening. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={Purpose: Invasive breast carcinoma is the most common cancer in women as in non-ovariectomised pet dogs, which are already identified as a valuable spontaneous preclinical model for that disease. Geographical and time trends suggest that environmental factors may play an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of breast cancer. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) fit perfectly with these trends and are known to interact with hormonal receptors implicated in breast cancer subtyping. The aim of this innovating study was to evaluate the interest of the companion dog model in assessing chemical exposure and breast cancer associations, in order to identify common etiological features with the human disease in a context of comparative oncology. Methods: We monitored a hundred of molecules belonging to a large panel of POPs (dioxins, dioxin-like and non dioxin-like polychlorobisphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, brominated flame retardants, perfluorinated alkylated substances) in companion dogs diagnosed for mammary adenocarcinoma (n = 54) and non cancer controls (n = 47). Results: All targeted chemical families were able to be detected in canine samples. We identified pollutants associated with mammary cancer belonging to the dioxin like-PCB family (notably PCB-118, -156, -105, -114) that were already pointed out in human epidemiological studies on breast cancer, and that fit with the fundamental role of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor in the promotion of breast cancer. Conclusions: Similarities observed in the spontaneous dog model are very helpful to progress in interpretation of human breast cancer-environment relationships. This study provides a new insight focusing on this discrete but recurrent signature. © 2015, Sévère et al. licensee Springer.},

abstract={Glycerophospholipids have been highlighted as the major lipids class affected by trenbolone acetate/estradiol implant administration in bovines. Non-targeted hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) and reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry have been successfully applied for characterizing lipid profile disruption in serum of implanted bovines. HILIC data pointed towards significant decrease of C22 fatty acids in implanted animals, i.e., C22:3 (p < 0.05), C22:4 (p < 0.05) and C22:6 (p < 0.01), whilst RPLC data confirmed depletion of glycerophospholipids (phosphatidylglycerols, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylethanolamine) with C22 fatty acid chains. Using these two complementary methods, complex lipids with the same alkyl chain have been putatively characterized and could further serve to understand the biological mechanism of illicit administration of trenbolone acetate/estradiol implant. These metabolites underpin glycerophospholipid metabolism as potential pathway, which was identified using metabolomic pathway analysis and MetExplore platforms. We hypothesized that implantation of exogenous androgenic and estrogenic steroids induces a depletion of glycerophospholipids with C22 FA chains, by decreasing high-density lipoproteins, the main transporters of glycerophospholipids in plasma. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The present study investigated the developmental neurotoxicity of an early exposure to α-HBCDD through the ingestion of contaminated hen's egg in pregnant and lactating Wistar female rats. Hens were given α-HBCDD-contaminated feed (40 ng/g fresh matter) for 5 and 10 days, which produced eggs with HBCDD content of 33 and 102 ng/g lipid weight, respectively. Female rats were administered daily p.o. with an appropriate volume of the whole egg from the day of fertilization (GD0) to the weaning day for pups (PND21). Fetuses and pups were thus exposed continuously to α-HBCDD via the dam over a whole 42-day period that included both gestation and lactation. The administered egg volume was calculated on the basis of daily egg consumption in humans (0.7 egg/person/day) and duration of gestation and lactation in both species, which led animals to be exposed to α-HBCDD at levels of 22 and 66 ng/kg/day, respectively. Neurobehavioral development of pups was investigated from PND3 to PND25 using various tasks including the righting reflex (PND4), the grasping reflex (PND5), the negative geotaxis (PND9), the forelimb grip strength test (PND10) and the locomotor coordination test (PND20). Pup ultrasonic vocalizations were also recorded daily from PND4 to PND14. After weaning, behaviors related to spontaneous locomotor activity and anxiety were examined in the open-field (PND25) and in an elevated-plus maze (PND26), respectively. The results showed a significant decrease in body weight of pups exposed to the lower HBCDD level from PND3 to PND28, whereas the weight of rat pups given 66 ng/kg/day of HBCDD was not different from controls. During the first 3 weeks of life, impairments in motor maturation of pups were observed in a dose-dependent manner depending on the test, whereas no significant differences were reported between male and female pups. At PND26, the anxiety level of female rats exposed to the lowest dose of HBCDD (22 ng/kg/day) was significantly reduced whereas it remained unchanged in males. No significant variations were measured in rats exposed to the higher level of HBCDD (66 ng/kg/day). These results suggest the potent developmental neurotoxicity of an early chronic exposure to the HBCDD α-isomer through the ingestion of hen's eggs contaminated with this pollutant and question the long-lasting consequences of this exposure on behavior abilities and brain functioning in adulthood. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={One major concern regarding perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) is their potential role in onset of health troubles consecutive to early exposure during the perinatal period. In the present work, the internal exposure levels of 18 targeted PFAAs were determined in ca. 100 mother-newborn pairs recruited in France between 2010 and 2013. In serum, the cumulated concentrations of the 7 most frequently detected compounds were 5.70. ng/mL and 2.83. ng/mL (median values) in maternal and cord serum, respectively. Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexylesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) contributed to around 90% of the total PFAAs contamination, with concentration levels and contamination profiles in accordance with other published work in Europe. Levels measured in breast milk were far lower (20 to 150 fold) than those determined in serum. Associations between the different monitored substances as well as between levels determined in the different investigated biological matrices mostly do not appear statistically significant. The estimated materno-foetal transfer would be thus substance-dependant, mainly driven by the physico-chemical properties of the different PFAAs (nature of polar group and length of alkylated side chain). We conclude that trans-placental passage and breastfeeding are both significant routes of human exposure to PFAAs. © 2015.},

abstract={The metabo-ring initiative brought together five nuclear magnetic resonance instruments (NMR) and 11 different mass spectrometers with the objective of assessing the reliability of untargeted metabolomics approaches in obtaining comparable metabolomics profiles. This was estimated by measuring the proportion of common spectral information extracted from the different LCMS and NMR platforms. Biological samples obtained from 2 different conditions were analysed by the partners using their own in-house protocols. Test #1 examined urine samples from adult volunteers either spiked or not spiked with 32 metabolite standards. Test #2 involved a low biological contrast situation comparing the plasma of rats fed a diet either supplemented or not with vitamin D. The spectral information from each instrument was assembled into separate statistical blocks. Correlations between blocks (e.g., instruments) were examined (RV coefficients) along with the structure of the common spectral information (common components and specific weights analysis). In addition, in Test #1, an outlier individual was blindly introduced, and its identification by the various platforms was evaluated. Despite large differences in the number of spectral features produced after post-processing and the heterogeneity of the analytical conditions and the data treatment, the spectral information both within (NMR and LCMS) and across methods (NMR vs. LCMS) was highly convergent (from 64 to 91 % on average). No effect of the LCMS instrumentation (TOF, QTOF, LTQ-Orbitrap) was noted. The outlier individual was best detected and characterised by LCMS instruments. In conclusion, untargeted metabolomics analyses report consistent information within and across instruments of various technologies, even without prior standardisation. © 2014, The Author(s).},

abstract={The use of anabolic agents in livestock production is a subject of much concern. Although prohibited for more than 20 years within the EU, growth promoting practices are still widely suspected. To meet the current challenges for detecting illicit practices, ‘omics’ strategies have recently been demonstrated as important new investigative tools. These investigations, based on the observation of physiological disturbances, mainly in urine, demonstrated the possibility to monitor biomarkers enabling high throughput determination of animal status in terms of hormonal treatment. In this context, serum was investigated for the first time as an alternative and potential complementary sample type. A metabolomic approach based on liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry, was exploited in order to, highlight metabolic perturbations in serum of Revalor-XS® (trenbolone acetate/estradiol) implanted bovines. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were carried out to establish descriptive and predictive models. These models enabled the discrimination of anabolised from control animals, and highlighted a number of metabolites which contributed the most in the observed discrimination. Further, a screening model combining a set of selected markers intensities was generated and it successfuly classified animals according to their status, up to 4 weeks post Revalor-XS® implant. This research indicates, for the first time, that serum metabolomics has an important role in screening to detect for anabolic misuse in bovines. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={New approaches, mainly based on mass spectrometry techniques, are being developed and appear as a must in the modern food science and microbiology research to investigate food quality and safety. To date, the investigation of cheese ripening mechanisms has mostly used targeted approaches. The aims of the present project were to assess the use of untargeted metabolomics as an approach to investigate the influence of altering one ripening parameter to generate fine differences in the microbial metabolism within cheese. Two cheeses were made which varied with respect to the spatial distribution of bacterial colonies, leading to cheeses with only big or only small colonies. Liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry metabolic fingerprints were acquired on cheese extracts collected after 2, 13 and 27 days of ripening using two different extraction methods (water or acetonitrile) and analyzed using two different simultaneous ionization modes (positive and negative electrospray). Data processing involving XCMS and multivariate statistical analysis highlighted significant discriminant profiles of the cheese metabolomes according to the two different spatial distributions compared. The different fractions investigated (water and acetonitrile extractions in two ionization modes) were complementary and resulted in a view as global as possible of the cheese metabolome which had been modulated by the spatial distribution of bacterial colonies. Some of the metabolites were then identified using an in-house database. These results show the relevance of cheese LC–HRMS fingerprinting to understand the influence of a ripening parameter generating fine differences on microbial metabolism within cheese. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={While the coupling of traveling wave ion mobility spectrometry (TWIMS) and mass spectrometry is mainly reported for structural purposes, we studied its potential in enhancing compounds analysis such as growth promoters used in livestock animals at trace concentrations. β-Adrenergic agonists have been selected as model compounds since they exhibit a range of close physicochemical properties leading to analytical issues using classical approaches. In this paper, the potential of Synapt G2-S (Q-TWIM-TOF MS) has been investigated for sensitive and specific detection of a range of these synthetic phenethanolamines in various complex biological matrices (retina, meat, and urine) from bovine considered as relevant in the context of detecting β-adrenergic agonists use in animals. In particular, the specificity of the additional information provided by the TWIMS (i.e., collision cross section) together with the interest of the extra dimension of separation is discussed. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The administration of synthetic homologues of naturally occurring steroids can be demonstrated by measuring 13C/12C isotopic ratios of their urinary metabolites. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-MS/C/IRMS) was used in this study to appraise in a global approach isotopic deviations of two 17β-testosterone metabolites (17α-testosterone and etiocholanolone) and one 17β-estradiol metabolite (17α-estradiol) together with those of 5-androstene-3β,17α-diol as endogenous reference compound (ERC). Intermediate precisions of 0.35‰, 1.05‰, 0.35‰, and 0.21‰, respectively, were observed (n = 8). To assess the performance of the analytical method, a bull and a heifer were treated with 17β-testosterone propionate and 17β-estradiol-3-benzoate. The sensitivity of the method permitted the demonstration of 17β-estradiol treatment up to 24 days. For 17β-testosterone treatment, the detection windows were 3 days and 24 days for the bull and the heifer, respectively. The capability of GC-MS/C/IRMS to demonstrate natural steroid abuse for urinary steroids was eventually compared to those of mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) when measuring intact steroid esters in blood and hair. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={A study was performed to determine if untargeted metabolomics of urine could be used to establish a predictive tool for identifying β-agonists misuse in cattle. Although prohibited for more than 20 years within the EU, growth promoting practices for livestock fattening purposes are still suspected. Methods based on gas- or liquid chromatography coupled to (tandem) mass spectrometry are today considered as the state-of-the-art to monitor, in a targeted approach, residues of known drugs. To overcome the detection of anabolic practices, new synthetic xenobiotic growth promoters have been designed and new ways of applications, such as the administration of low dose cocktails, have been developed. In this context, innovative screening strategies are urgently needed to enable efficient control of such practices. Omic technologies have recently shown their relevance in highlighting physiological response resulting from anabolic compounds administration. LC-HRMS based metabolomics is one of the approaches allowing profiling biological matrices to reveal biological effects of a drug. In the present work, a metabolomics study performed on urine samples collected in the frame of several independent experiments involving different animals, different β-agonists treatments and different parameters (doses, compounds mixture, treatment length), allowed highlighting biomarkers of interest and implementing a robust statistical model to predict for β-agonists treated bovines. Performances of the proposed model fit with EU requirements for screening methods. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Abstract Bisphenol A (BPA) is an industrial chemical widely used in the production of polycarbonate and epoxy resins. Identified as an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC), BPA is a matter of existing or ongoing restrictive regulations and then is increasingly being replaced by other analogues used as BPA's substitutes. Human biomonitoring studies focusing on both BPA and emerging related analogues consequently appear as a requirement either for documenting the efficiency of regulatory actions toward BPA and for fuelling incoming risk assessment studies toward BPA's substitutes. In particular, the increasing concern about the late effects consecutive to early exposures naturally identify human breast milk as a target biological matrix of interest for priority exposure assessment focused on critical sub-populations such as pregnant women, fetuses, and/or newborns. In this context, an accurate and sensitive analytical method based on gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) was developed for the quantification of 18 "BPA-like" compounds in breast milk samples at trace levels (<0.05 μg kg-1). The method includes a preliminary protein precipitation step followed by two successive solid-phase extraction (SPE) stages. Quantification of the targeted compounds was achieved according to the isotopic dilution method using 13C<inf>12</inf>-BPA as internal standard. The method was validated according to current EU guidelines and criteria. Linearity (R2) was better than 0.99 for each molecule within the concentration range 0-5 μg kg-1. The detection and quantification limits ranged from 0.001 to 0.030 μg kg-1 and from 0.002 to 0.050 μg kg-1, respectively. The analytical method was successfully applied to the first set of human breast milk samples (n=30) originating from French women in the Region Pays-de-la-Loire. The measured levels of BPA were found in the <LOQ-1.16 μg kg-1 range. BPS was detected in only one sample at 0.23 μg kg-1, while the other targeted molecules were not detected. The proposed methodology then appeared suitable for the further monitoring of a potential decrease of BPA levels and an increase of other BPA analogue levels as reflective of the expected incoming trend in terms of human exposure. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Few studies have been undertaken to assess the possible effects of bisphenol A (BPA) on the reproductive hormone balance in animals or humans with often contradictory results. We investigated possible direct endocrine disruption by BPA of the fetal testes of 2 rat strains (14.5-17.5 days post-coitum) and humans (8-12 gestational weeks) and under different culture conditions. BPA concentrations of 10-8M and 10-5M for 72h reduced testosterone production by the Sprague-Dawley fetal rat testes, while only 10-5M suppressed it in the Wistar strain. The suppressive effects at 10-5M were seen as early as 24h and 48h in both strains. BPA at 10-7-10-5M for 72h suppressed the levels of fetal rat Leydig cell insulinlike factor 3 (INSL3). BPA exposure at 10-8M, 10-7M, and 10-5M for 72h inhibited testosterone production in fetal human testes. For the lowest doses, the effects observed occurred only when no gonadotrophin was added to the culture media and were associated with a poorly preserved testicular morphology. We concluded that (i) BPA can display antiandrogenic effects both in rat and human fetal testes; (ii) it is essential to ascertain that the divergent effects of endocrine disruptors between species in vitro do not result from the culture conditions used, and/or the rodent strain selected; (iii) the optimization of each in vitro assay for a given species should be a major objective rather than the search of an hypothetical trans-species consensual model-system, as the organization of the testis is intrinsically different between mammalian species; (iv) due to the uncertainty existing on the internal exposure of the human fetal testis to BPA, and the insufficient number of epidemiological studies on the endocrine disruptive effects of BPA, caution should be taken in the extrapolation of our present results to the human reproductive health after fetal exposure to BPA. © 2015 Maamar et al.},

abstract={Thiouracil is a thyrostat inhibiting the thyroid function, resulting in fraudulent weight gain if applied in the fattening of livestock. The latter abuse is strictly forbidden and monitored in the European Union. Recently, endogenous sources of thiouracil were identified after frequently monitoring low-level thiouracil positive urine samples and a "recommend concentration" (RC) of 10 ∼g/L was suggested by the EURL to facilitate decision-making. However, the systematic occurrence of urine samples exceeding the RC led to demands for international surveys defining an epidemiologic threshold. Therefore, six European member states (France, Poland, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, Norway, and Belgium) have shared their official thiouracil data (2010-2012) collected from bovines, porcines, and small livestock with 95 and 99% percentiles of 8.1 and 18.2 ∼g/L for bovines (n = 3894); 7.4 and 13.5 ∼g/L for porcines (n = 654); and 7.4 ∼g/L (95% only) for small livestock (n = 85), respectively. Bovine percentiles decreased with the animal age (nonadults had significantly higher levels for bovines), and higher levels were observed in male bovines compared to female bovines. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The chemical contamination of the Loire estuary by three classes of persistent organic pollutants (POPs): the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), the polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and the perfluorinated and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS), and three families of organic contaminants, the alkylphenols (APs), the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites (OH-PAHs) and the bisphenol A (BPA) were investigated in the muscles and bile of European eel (. Anguilla anguilla). Yellow eels (n. =. 30) were caught in three different points along the estuary to highlight variations between sites and sources of contaminations. Silver eels (n. =. 15) were also studied to compare contaminant impregnation between different life stages of the species. Average concentrations in the muscles of the eel ranged between: 857 and 4358. ng/g. LW for the PCBs, 26 and 46. ng/g. LW for the PBDEs, 130 and 1293. ng/g. LW for the PFAS; and in bile: 31 and 286. μg/g protein for the APs, 9 and 26. μg/g protein for the OH-PAHs and ND-1213. μg/g protein for the BPA. Among PCBs, PCB 153 (40% contribution to the sum of PCBs) was predominant in all eel muscles. PBDE 47 (60%) was the most predominant PBDE congeners, while perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (85%) was the most widely detected PFAS. For APs, 4p-nonylphenol (91%) was the most abundant and for the OH-PAHs, it was 1OH-Pyrene (63%). All the eels exceeded the environmental quality standards (EQS) for biota for the PBDEs and about 75% were higher than the EQS specific to PFOS. Finally, 20% of the analyzed eels presented TEQ concentrations above the maximum limits for lipid-rich species. These results supplied new data on the occurrence, levels, and patterns of 53 organic chemicals in the eels from the Loire estuary and they highlighted the need of further investigations focused notably on the potential effects of these chemicals on this species and their analysis in the water and sediments of the estuary. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Introduction: Polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) are persistent pollutants that are widespread in the environment and in foodstuffs, particularly in freshwater fish, which frequently exceed the maximum levels set by European regulations. Objectives: First, we describe the consumption of freshwater fish and serum PCB levels in French anglers, a population expected to have the highest level of dietary PCB exposure. Second, we investigated whether there is a statistical relationship between serum PCB levels and the angler consumption of freshwater fish with high PCB bioaccumulation potential (PCB-BP+ freshwater fish) in order to make recommendations with regard to safe consumption of freshwater fish. Methods: We conducted a survey of anglers from six sites with contrasting PCB contamination levels. The survey included a food consumption frequency questionnaire and blood samples were taken to assess serum PCB levels. We used a regression model to determine the main factors contributing to serum PCB levels. Results: Consumption of PCB-BP+ freshwater fish was relatively infrequent. Serum PCB levels of the study population and of women of childbearing age were in the same range as those observed in the French population and in neighbouring European countries, but higher than in the North American population.The two factors with the highest positive association with serum PCB levels were age (R2=61%) and the consumption of PCB-BP+ freshwater fish (R2=2%). Using the regression model, we calculated, for several scenarios depending on the age and gender of the population, the maximum annual frequencies for PCB-BP+ freshwater fish consumption that do not exceed the critical body burden threshold. Conclusion: Following the results of this study, the French agency for food, environmental and occupational health and safety (ANSES) issued an opinion and recommended some specific maximum freshwater fish consumption frequencies to protect the French general population. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={High throughput screening is essential for doping, forensic, and food safety laboratories. While hyphenated chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) remains the approach of choice, recent ambient MS techniques, such as direct analysis in real time (DART), offer more rapid and more versatile strategies and thus gain in popularity. In this study, the potential of DART hyphenated with Orbitrap-MS for fast identification and quantification of 21 anabolic steroid esters has been evaluated. Direct analysis in high resolution scan mode allowed steroid esters screening by accurate mass measurement (Resolution=60 000 and mass error<3ppm). Steroid esters identification was further supported by collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments through the generation of two additional ions. Moreover, the use of labelled internal standards allowed quantitative data to be recovered based on isotopic dilution approach. Linearity (R2>0.99), dynamic range (from 1 to 1000ngmL-1), bias (<10%), sensitivity (1ngmL-1), repeatability and reproducibility (RSD<20%) were evaluated as similar to those obtained with hyphenated chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques. This innovative high throughput approach was successfully applied for the characterization of oily commercial preparations, and thus fits the needs of the competent authorities in the fight against forbidden or counterfeited substances. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Chlordecone is an organochlorine pesticide (OCP) considered as a Persistent Organic Pollutant (POP) asit persists in the environment, bio-accumulates through the food web, causes adverse effects to humanhealth and the environment and transports across international boundaries far from its sources. Theatypical physico-chemical properties of chlordecone make its inclusion in classical analytical approachesnon applicable. The aim of our work was to include chlordecone in a multi organochlorine residue methodpreventing any degradation during the analytical process and thus allowing quantification at ppt (ng kg-1or ng L-1) levels for a wide range of OCPs in breast milk, human serum and adipose tissue. After GC-HRMSvs. MS/MS and EI vs. APCI comparisons, the major improvement in terms of sensitivity was found indecreasing the length and film thickness of the gas chromatography column. Thanks to a linear correlationbetween relative response and quantity of chlordecone injected, LC-(ESI-)-MS/MS was finally preferred. An acetonitrile based gradient optimized on a C30 coreshell HPLC column has led to reaching limitsof quantification as low as 8 ng L-1, 25 pg mL-1and 0.2 ng g-1fat for breast milk, serum and adiposetissue, respectively, allowing multiresidue OCP quantification at concentration levels compatible withbiomonitoring purposes and pre-requisites. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Perinatal undernutrition affects not only fetal and neonatal growth but also adult health outcome, as suggested by the metabolic imprinting concept. Although maternal milk is the only channel through which nutrients are transferred from mother to offspring during the postnatal period, the impact of maternal undernutrition on milk composition is poorly understood. The present study investigates, in a rat model of nutritional programming, the effects of feeding an isocaloric, low-protein diet throughout gestation and lactation on milk composition and its possible consequences on offspring's growth and metabolic status. We used an integrated methodological approach that combined targeted analyses of macronutrients, free amino acid and fatty acid content throughout lactation, with an untargeted mass-spectrometric-based metabolomic phenotyping. Whereas perinatal dietary protein restriction failed to alter milk protein content, it dramatically decreased the concentration of most free amino acids at the end of lactation. Interestingly, a decrease of several amino acids involved in insulin secretion or gluconeogenesis was observed, suggesting that maternal protein restriction during the perinatal period may impact the insulinotrophic effect of milk, which may, in turn, account for the slower growth of the suckled male offspring. Besides, the decrease in sulfur amino acids may alter redox status in the offspring. Maternal undernutrition was also associated with an increase in milk total fatty acid content, with modifications in their pattern. Altogether, our results show that milk composition is clearly influenced by maternal diet and suggest that alterations in milk composition may play a role in offspring growth and metabolic programming. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Current contamination levels of selected legacy, currently-used and emerging halogenated contaminants were monitored in marine shellfish along French coastlines. The studied contaminants included polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDDs), 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE), decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE), hexabromobenzene (HBB), 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromobiphenyl (BB-153) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs).BDE-47, BDE-209, BTBPE, HBB and α-HBCDD were detected in 100% of the analyzed samples, whereas BB-153, DBDPE and PFOS were detected at frequencies of 97%, 90% and 55%, respectively. Concentrations were in the pgg-1ww range and varied as follows: PFOS&gt;BDE-47~α-HBCDD&gt;BDE-209&gt;BTBPE~DBDPE&gt;HBB~BB-153. Overall, non-PBDE Brominated Flame Retardants (BFRs) revealed concentrations between 3 and 59 times lower than those of PBDEs.PBDE pattern was dominated by BDE-47, followed by BDE-99. &gt;. BDE-100. &gt;. BDE-49. &gt;. BDE-209. &gt;. BDE-154; these 6 congeners represented 94% of the summed ten PBDEs. PFC pattern determination revealed PFOS as the predominant PFC in samples from the English Channel and Atlantic, whereas perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) prevailed in Mediterranean samples. Temporal trend investigations on archived samples from the Mediterranean coast collected between 1981 and 2012 showed a prevalence of PFOS until 1998; PFCAs subsequently increased and became more abundant than PFOS. High levels of PFCAs were observed until 2008, followed by a decrease and stabilization in 2010-2012. Amongst PFCAs, perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA) and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA) were predominant and exhibited similar time trends, suggesting similar sources at the investigated site, home to major industrial activity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={PFAS are man-made compounds that are highly spread in the environment. Human dietary exposure to such contaminants is of high concern as they may accumulate in the food chain. Different studies already demonstrated the importance of the fish consumption in the dietary exposure of these molecules and the potential increase of internal doses of PFAS following the consumption of PFAS. However, so far few study aimed to study the link between the consumption of fresh water fishes and the internal exposure to PFAS. Objectives of this study were (i) to estimate the internal exposure of populations that are potentially high consumers of fresh water fishes and (ii) to determine whether the consumption of fish caught from fresh water is a significant determinant of the internal exposure of PFAS. In this work, a large sample of adult freshwater anglers from the French metropolitan population (478 individuals) was constituted randomly from participants lists of anglers associations. Questionnaires provided social and demographic information and diet information for each subject. In addition, analyses of blood serum samples provided the internal concentration of 14 PFAS. The survey design allowed to extrapolate the data obtained on the 478 individuals to the freshwater angler population. Descriptive data regarding internal levels of PFAS were discussed at the population level, whereas identification of the determinants were done at the 478 individuals level as sufficient contrast was required in terms of fresh water fish consumption. Only molecules for which the detection frequency were above 80% in blood were considered, i.e., PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS, PFNA, PFHpS, and PFDA. Distribution profiles showed log-normal distribution and PFOS and PFOA were the main contributors of the PFAS sum. For PFOS, the results obtained on the 478 individuals showed that upper percentiles were higher as compared to upper percentiles obtained on occidental general population. This confirmed an over-exposure of a fraction of the 478 individuals. Though, when the results were considered at the population level, the values were close. This was attributed to the low consumption frequency of fresh water fish in the general population. For PFOS, PFNA, PFHxS, PFHpS and PFDA, the fresh water fish consumption was identified as one of the contributors of internal PFAS concentrations. Gender, age, geographical location and consumption of home-grown products as other determinants were also discussed in this paper. © 2014.},

This study was designed to reflect the consumption habits of the French population and covered the most important foods in terms of consumption, selected nutrients and contribution to contamination. Based on French consumption data, the present study reports the dietary exposure to perfluoroalkyl acids (16 congeners) and brominated flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers, hexabromocyclododecane and polybrominated biphenyls). Comparison of the calculated dietary exposures with the generally accepted health-based guidance values revealed that most compounds do not pose any risk.

abstract={Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are globally found in various media, including food and especially fishery products. In the present study, the dietary exposure to 15 perfluoroalkyl acids was assessed for 3 French adult populations, namely high seafood consumers, high freshwater fish consumers, and pregnant women. Purified food extracts were analysed by LC-MS/MS and PFBA, PFPA, PFHxA, PFHpA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnA, PFTrDA, PFTeDA, PFBS, PFHxS, PFHpS, PFOS and PFDS were monitored and quantified according to the isotope dilution principle. Under lower bound (LB) hypothesis (i.e. contamination values&lt;LOD considered as 0), high freshwater fish consumers appear as the most exposed to PFOS (7.5ng.kg-1 bw.d-1), PFUnA (1.3ng.kg-1 bw.d-1), PFDA (0.4ng.kg-1 bw.d-1) and PFHpS (0.03ng.kg-1 bw.d-1) while high seafood consumers appear as the most exposed to PFOA (1.2ng.kg-1 bw.d-1), PFNA (0.2ng.kg-1 bw.d-1) and PFHxS (0.06ng.kg-1 bw.d-1). For all considered populations, the major exposure contributors are fish, seafood and water under LB hypothesis, while dairy products, bread and crispbread are the main contributors under upper bound (UB) hypothesis. Besides this food exposure assessment, further studies are needed to assess the more global PFAA exposure, taking into account indoor and outdoor air, dust and cutaneous contact, which could be other important contributors for this particular class of chemicals. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The toxic equivalent concentrations (WHO-TEQfish) were also determined in order to evaluate which P. flesus population was more exposed to dioxin-like toxicity. Juveniles caught in the Sørfjord (Norway) showed the lowest WHO-TEQfish concentration (0.052pg WHO-TEQfishg-1wet weight) whereas the highest value was observed in fish from the Wadden Sea (The Netherlands; 0.291pg WHO-TEQfishg-1ww), mainly due to the greater contribution of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, the most toxic congener. Nonetheless, when comparing the results with existent tissue residue-based toxicity benchmarks, no adverse effects resulting from PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs are expected to occur in flounder from the studied systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In this study, French marine and freshwater fish perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) contamination are presented along with their fatty acid (FA) composition to provide further elements for a risk/benefit balance of fish consumption to be assessed. The 29 most consumed marine fish species were collected in four metropolitan French coastal areas in 2004 to constitute composite samples. Geographical differences in terms of consumed species and contamination level were taken into account. Three hundred and eighty-seven composite samples corresponding to 16 freshwater fish species collected between 2008 and 2010 in the six major French rivers or their tributaries were selected among the French national agency for water and aquatic environments freshwater fish sample library. The raw edible parts were analyzed for FA composition and PFAA contamination. Results show that freshwater fishes are more contaminated by PFAAs than marine fishes and do not share the same contamination profile. Freshwater fish contamination is mostly driven by perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) (75%), whereas marine fish contamination is split between perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (24%), PFOS (20%), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) (15%), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFHpA) (11%), and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) (11%). Common carp, pike-perch, European perch, thicklip grey mullet, and common roach presented the most unfavorable balance profile due to their high level of PFAAs and low level of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs). These data could be used, if needed, in an updated opinion on fish consumption that takes into account PFAA contamination. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The goal of this project was to investigate the effects and possible developmental disease implication of chronic dietary TCDD exposure on global gene expression anchored to histopathologic analysis in juvenile zebrafish by functional genomic, histopathologic and analytic chemistry methods. Specifically, juvenile zebrafish were fed Biodiet starter with TCDD added at 0, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 ppb, and fish were sampled following 0, 7, 14, 28 and 42 d after initiation of the exposure. TCDD accumulated in a dose- and time-dependent manner and 100 ppb TCDD caused TCDD accumulation in female (15.49 ppb) and male (18.04 ppb) fish at 28 d post exposure. Dietary TCDD caused multiple lesions in liver, kidney, intestine and ovary of zebrafish and functional dysregulation such as depletion of glycogen in liver, retrobulbar edema, degeneration of nasal neurosensory epithelium, underdevelopment of intestine, and diminution in the fraction of ovarian follicles containing vitellogenic oocytes. Importantly, lesions in nasal epithelium and evidence of endocrine disruption based on alternatively spliced vasa transcripts are two novel and significant results of this study. Microarray gene expression analysis comparing vehicle control to dietary TCDD revealed dysregulated genes involved in pathways associated with cardiac necrosis/cell death, cardiac fibrosis, renal necrosis/cell death and liver necrosis/cell death. These baseline toxicological effects provide evidence for the potential mechanisms of developmental dysfunctions induced by TCDD and vasa as a biomarker for ovarian developmental disruption. © 2014 Liu et al.},

abstract={Recent developments in ambient mass spectrometry (AMS), such as atmospheric solids analysis probe (ASAP) mass spectrometry, open a whole new range of possibilities to screen for drug preparations. In this study, the potential of ASAP for the rapid identification and quantification of anabolic steroid esters has been evaluated. These compounds are known to be used both in human and in food producing animals to enhance performances and to improve the rate of growth, respectively. Using a triple quadrupole (QqQ) MS instrument, mechanism of ionization and fragmentation in both positive and negative mode were studied for a range of 21 selected steroid esters (based on testosterone, estradiol, nandrolone, and boldenone) which highlighted common neutral mass loss of 96.1, thus allowing rapid screening in minutes to reveal steroid ester presence with minimal sample preparation. Ester identification is further achieved through an efficient 2 min workflow on a QqQ MS instrument. Moreover, the use of isotope labeled internal standards permitted the quantification of the corresponding steroid esters in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode, for the first time in ASAP. This approach was successfully applied for characterization of oily commercial preparations. These results open new perspectives in hormone (and drug) rapid analysis by ASAP-MS in the near future. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={This study aimed at evaluating and comparing five integrative samplers for the monitoring of indicator and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in water: semi-permeable membrane device (SPMD), silicone rubber, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) strip, Chemcatcher and a continuous-flow integrative sampler (CFIS). These samplers were spiked with performance reference compounds (PRCs) and then simultaneously exposed under constant agitation and temperature in a 200 L stainless steel tank for periods ranging from one day to three months. A constant PCB concentration of about 1ng·L-1 was achieved by immersing a large amount of silicone rubber sheets ("dosing sheets") spiked with the target PCBs. The uptake of PCBs in the five samplers showed overall good repeatability and their accumulation was linear with time. The samplers SPMD, silicone rubber and LDPE strip were the most promising in terms of achieving low limits of quantification. Time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations of PCBs in water were estimated from uptake of PCBs using the sampling rates calculated from the release of PRCs. Except for Chemcatcher, a good agreement was found between the different samplers and TWA concentrations ranged between 0.4 and 2.8 times the nominal water concentration. Finally, the influence of calculation methods (sampler-water partition coefficients, selected PRCs, models) on final TWA concentrations was studied. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Concentrations and profiles of 2,3,7,8-substituted polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) were investigated in sediment and plants collected from a salt marsh in the Tejo estuary, Portugal. The highest PCDD/F and dl-PCB concentrations were detected in uncolonized sediments, averaging 325.25 ± 57.55 pg g-1 dry weight (dw) and 8,146.33 ± 2,142.14 pg g-1 dw, respectively. The plants Sarcocornia perennis and Halimione portulacoides growing in PCDD/F and dl-PCB contaminated sediments accumulated contaminants in roots, stems, and leaves. It was observed that PCDD/F and dl-PCB concentrations in roots were significantly lower in comparison with stems and leaves. In general, concentration of ΣPCDD/Fs and Σdl-PCBs in H. portulacoides tissues were found to be twofold higher than those in S. perennis, indicating a difference in the accumulation capability of both species. Furthermore, congener profiles changed between sediments and plant tissues, reflecting a selective accumulation of low chlorinated PCDD/Fs and non-ortho dl-PCBs in plants. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the contribution of both foetal and/or post-natal nutritional periods on feeding regulation in adult rats. Methods: Body weight gain, adipose tissue development, food preferences and feeding pattern under regular chow or Western diets were characterized on four experimental groups of rats: pups born from protein-restricted dams (R) and weaned by control (RC) or R dams (RR) and pups born from control dams weaned by C (CC) or R dams (CR). Results: Rats born with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and fed a Western diet at adulthood appeared predisposed to body weight gain and more fat accretion, whereas CR rats, despite their preference for high-fat diet and their hyperphagia for Western diet, did not show significant increase in fat tissue. Daytime food intakes, as well as their speed of ingestion, were found modified in RC and RR. Alterations in the hypothalamic appetite regulatory mechanisms were investigated through neuropeptide expression analysis. IUGR rats showed altered expression of key elements of leptin and NPY signalling, while CR rats exhibited lesser expression of enterostatin, MC4r and HT-1Br mRNA. Conclusion: Altogether, these results indicate that peri-natal nutrition has different lasting effects on feeding pattern and hypothalamic appetite regulation, depending on the time window insult. © 2013 Scandinavian Physiological Society.},

abstract={The emerging field of metabolomics, aiming to characterize small molecule metabolites present in biological systems, promises immense potential for different areas such as medicine, environmental sciences, agronomy, etc. The purpose of this article is to guide the reader through the history of the field, then through the main steps of the metabolomics workflow, from study design to structure elucidation, and help the reader to understand the key phases of a metabolomics investigation and the rationale underlying the protocols and techniques used. This article is not intended to give standard operating procedures as several papers related to this topic were already provided, but is designed as a tutorial aiming to help beginners understand the concept and challenges of MS-based metabolomics. A real case example is taken from the literature to illustrate the application of the metabolomics approach in the field of doping analysis. Challenges and limitations of the approach are then discussed along with future directions in research to cope with these limitations.

abstract={BPA-containing products are widely used in foodstuffs packaging as authorized within the European Union (UE no. 10/2011). Therefore, foods and beverages are in contact with BPA which can migrate from food contact material to foodstuffs. An accurate assessment of the exposure of the consumers to BPA is crucial for a non-ambiguous risk characterization. In this context, an efficient analytical method using gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS), in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode, was developed for the quantification of BPA in foodstuffs at very low levels (&lt;0.5μgkg-1). A standard operating procedure, based on the combination of two successive solid phase extractions (SPE), was developed for various liquid and solid foodstuffs. The use of 13C12-BPA as internal standard allowed accurate quantification of BPA by isotopic dilution. Control charts based on both blank and certified materials have been implemented to ensure analytical data quality. The developed analytical method has been validated according to in-house validation requirements. R2 was better than 0.9990 within the range [0-100μgkg-1], the trueness was 4.2%. Repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility ranged from 7.5% to 19.0% and 2.5% to 12.2%, respectively, at 0.5 and 5.0μgkg-1 depending on the matrices tested for. The detection and quantification limits were 0.03 and 0.10μgkg-1, respectively. The reporting limit was 0.35μgkg-1, taking into account the mean of the laboratory background contamination. The global uncertainty was 22.2% at 95% confidence interval. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The use of anabolic agents in meat producing animals is forbidden in Europe since 1988. Nevertheless, the possibility of widespread abuse of hormonal substances still exists, mainly due to economical benefits. The use of “omics” approach is a promising strategy to highlight anabolic hormone abuse by indirectly detecting their physiological action. In this context, the aim of this work was to set up a liquid chromatography – high resolution mass spectrometry based metabolomics workflow for the screening of a combined trenbolone acetate/estradiol implant abuse in cattle urine. Therefore, an untargeted metabolomics approach combining the information provided by reverse-phase liquid chromatography and hydrophilic interaction chromatography both coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry was developed and applied to characterize and compare cattle urinary metabolic profiles from non-implanted and implanted animals. The combination of both separation modes improved the metabolite information richness. Discrimination between treated and untreated animals was observed by application of multivariate statistical analysis. Moreover, OPLS models permitted to highlight the candidate biomarkers appearing as the ions which contribute the most in the observed discrimination. From the results obtained, metabolomics approaches can be considered as a powerful strategy for the detection of fraudulent anabolic treatments in cattle since global urinary metabolic response provides helpful discrimination. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Urine is an ideal biofluid for metabolomics studies since it is obtained noninvasively, and its composition is affected by genetic and environmental factors reflecting the physiology of multiple organs. However, urine dilution effects and instrumental variation from the analytical method play a significant confounding role when one attempts to characterize biological and physiological factors through NMR and MS measurements of small molecule concentrations. Several normalization approaches have been used for urinary metabolomics studies and normalization to osmolality or to total useful MS signal have been proposed. When dealing with urinary metabolome analysis in cattle, freeze-drying (FD) is the method commonly used for normalization purposes. Herein, normalization to specific gravity, which provides a fair estimation of urine osmolality, was compared to the time consuming FD step and to the normalization to total useful MS signal in order to assess if this approach could be used as normalization strategy to differentiate control from anabolic treated animals. The results revealed that ~80 % of the metabolites detected as constituting the acquired MS fingerprints for the freeze-dried samples and for the samples normalized to both specific gravity (SG) and total useful MS signal were in common. In addition, similar information from the multivariate statistical analysis was obtained by both normalization approaches. We demonstrate, therefore, that SG can be used as normalization approach for urinary metabolome analysis in cattle resulting in a high sample throughput procedure when compared with the FD step. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Nandrolone (17β-hydroxy-4-estren-3-one) is amongst the most misused endogenous steroid hormones in entire male horses. The detection of such a substance is challenging with regard to its endogenous presence. The current international threshold level for nandrolone misuse is based on the urinary concentration ratio of 5α-estrane-3β,17α-diol (EAD) to 5(10)-estrene-3β,17α-diol (EED). This ratio, however, can be influenced by a number of factors due to existing intra- and inter-variability standing, respectively, for the variation occurring in endogenous steroids concentration levels in a single subject and the variation in those same concentration levels observed between different subjects. Targeting an efficient detection of nandrolone misuse in entire male horses, an analytical strategy was set up in order to profile a group of endogenous steroids in nandrolone-treated and non-treated equines. Experiment plasma and urine samples were steadily collected over more than three months from a stallion administered with nandrolone laurate (1mg/kg). Control plasma and urine samples were collected monthly from seven non-treated stallions over a one-year period. A large panel of steroids of interest (n=23) were extracted from equine urine and plasma samples using a C18 cartridge. Following a methanolysis step, liquid-liquid and solid-phase extractions purifications were performed before derivatization and analysis on gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) for quantification. Statistical processing of the collected data permitted to establish statistical models capable of discriminating control samples from those collected during the three months following administration. Furthermore, these statistical models succeeded in predicting the compliance status of additional samples collected from racing horses. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Experimental studies have shown that dioxin-like chemicals may interfere with aspects of the endocrine system including growth. However, human background population studies are, however, scarce. We aimed to investigate whether early exposure of healthy infants to dioxin-like chemicals was associated with changes in early childhood growth and serum IGF1. In 418 maternal breast milk samples of Danish children (born 1997-2001) from a longitudinal cohort, we measured polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans, and polychlorinated biphenyls (pg or ng/g lipid) and calculated total toxic equivalent (total TEQ). SDS and SDS changes over time (ΔSDS) were calculated for height, weight, BMI, and skinfold fat percentage at 0, 3, 18, and 36 months of age. Serum IGF1 was measured at 3 months. We adjusted for confounders using multivariate regression analysis. Estimates (in parentheses) correspond to a fivefold increase in total TEQ. TEQ levels in breast milk increased significantly with maternal age and fish consumption and decreased with maternal birth year, parity, and smoking. Total TEQ was associated with lower fat percentage (-0.45 S.D., CI: -0.89; -0.04), non-significantly with lower weight and length at 0 months, accelerated early height growth (increased DSDS) (DSDS 0-18 months: +0.77 S.D., CI: 0.34; 1.19) and early weight increase (DSDS 0-18: +0.52 S.D., CI: 0.03; 1.00), and increased IGF1 serum levels at 3 months (+13.9 ng/ml, CI: 2.3; 25.5). Environmental exposure to dioxin-like chemicals was associated with being skinny at birth and with higher infant levels of circulating IGF1 as well as accelerated early childhood growth (rapid catch-up growth). © 2014 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.},

Dams were gavaged with 4-n-NP (0, 50 and 200. mg/kg/day) from gestational day 5 to postnatal day (PND) 21. Dams exposed to the higher dose lost weight during gestation and had a longer gestational duration. Juvenile female pups of the 200. mg 4-n-NP/kg/day group were lighter. Their thyroid somatic index (TSI) was also affected. For male pups, a decrease of TSI at weaning for the 200. mg 4-n-NP/kg/day group and an increase of GSI for the 50. mg 4-n-NP/kg/day group were observed. Physical maturation (incisives and eyes) were likewise affected. In open field (OF) tests, females were more active than males. In the first OF (PND 36), a treatment effect was observed only for males, particularly for the high dose group, which became as active as females. The second OF (PND 71) showed few differences between groups (treated vs control), the gender difference whatever the dose was not abolished. In the Morris Water Maze test, the study of the first 30. s showed that females (200. mg/kg/day) were mainly affected. Their performances were improved by 4-n-NP. These effects were particularly important for the first short-term memory test and observed to a lesser extent in the second evaluation of the long-term memory (PND 69). These data showed that perinatal 4-n-NP exposure induced behavioral and neuro-developmental impairments from 50. mg/kg/day. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Superficial sediments collected from seven estuarine systems located along the Portuguese coast were analyzed for 7 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), 10 polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and 12 dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs). Total PCDD/F concentration ranged from 4.6 to 464 pg g-1 dry weight (dw), while that of dl-PCBs varied from 26.6 to 8,693 pg g-1 dw. In general, the highest PCDD/F and dl-PCB concentrations were associated with densely populated and industrially impacted areas. Additionally, PCDD/F revealed a predominance of octachlorodibenzodioxin (OCDD) to total PCDD/Fs, while PCB 118 was the major contributor to total dl-PCBs. This study provided a global perspective of the contamination status of Portuguese estuaries by dioxin-like compounds and allowed a comparison between the investigated systems and other systems worldwide. PCDD/F and dl-PCB levels found in the collected sediments were lower than those of highly impacted areas from different parts of the globe. Nevertheless, comparison with guidelines and quality standards from other countries indicated that some Portuguese estuarine areas with a high industrialization level present PCDD/F and dl-PCB concentrations in superficial sediment that may constitute a risk to aquatic organisms. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Bisphenol A (BPA) is used in a wide variety of products and objects for consumers use (digital media such as CD's and DVD's, sport equipment, food and beverage containers, medical equipment). Here, we demonstrate the ubiquitous presence of this contaminant in foods with a background level of contamination of less than 5. μg/kg in 85% of the 1498 analysed samples. High levels of contamination (up to 400. μg/kg) were found in some foods of animal origin. We used a probabilistic approach to calculate dietary exposure from French individual consumption data for infants under 36. months, children and adolescents from 3 to 17. years, adults over 18. years and pregnant women. The estimated average dietary exposure ranged from 0.12 to 0.14. μg/kg body weight per day (bw/d) for infants, from 0.05 to 0.06. μg/kg bw/d for children and adolescents, from 0.038 to 0.040. μg/kg bw/d for adults and from 0.05 to 0.06. μg/kg bw/d for pregnant women. The main sources of exposure were canned foods (50% of the total exposure), products of animal origin (20%) and 30% as a background level. Based on the toxicological values set by the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) for pregnant women, the risk was non negligible. Thus, we simulated scenarios to study the influence of cans and/or food of animal origin on the BPA-related risk for this specific population. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In Madagascar, little information about drug residues in animal products is available. However, recently, official veterinary services were informed about the misuse of human injectable contraceptives in pig farms as an alternative for chirurgical castration of adult sows before culling. We investigated pigs (n = 80) slaughtered in 7 Malagasy abattoirs and raised in 8 of the 22 Malagasy regions (1) to confirm the contamination of carcasses by anabolic hormones by using LC-MS/MS, (2) to identify the substances of concern and (3) to explore the consumers' exposure to hormone residues. Medroxyprogesterone acetate was the only synthetic hormone detected in kidney fat. Samples positive with medroxyprogesterone acetate were observed in 66.7% of the districts investigated and in 87.5% of the surveyed regions, confirming its large misuse in livestock. Public awareness campaigns and control improvement among the animal production sector and among the Malagasy public health sector are therefore urgent. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Microalgae appear to be one of the most promising sustainable resources as alternative crops for the production of renewable transport fuel. The exploitation of this bioresource requires, however, a fine monitoring of the culture conditions, for example by using more relevant control variables than usual macroscopic indicators (biomass or pigment estimation). In this proof of concept study, we propose to search potential biomarkers of progressive nitrogen regime culture conditions using an untargeted metabolomic approach based on LC-HRMS combined to a non-invasive analysis based on FTIR spectroscopy. One microalgae model was investigated i.e. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to characterize the effect of progressive nitrogen regime in batch culture conditions on its metabolome. FTIR allowed assessing the intracellular macrometabolic perturbations, highlighting the over-accumulation of carbohydrates. LC-HRMS complemented the macromolecular information by revealing the dependence of microalgae metabotypes on nitrogen regime conditions tested for cells culture. Patterns of significantly modulated metabolites were also detected during those slight contrasted nitrogen regimes and interesting features were structurally elucidated. This included metabolites belonging to the pantothenate, branched chain and aromatic amino acids pathways. In the last step of this proof of concept study, amino acid targets proposed by metabolomic investigations were assessed on nitrogen-limited continuous culture on photobioreactors. This was performed to test the validity of proposed targets in real small-scale industrial production conditions. Results were very encouraging and suggested the possibility of using potentially relevant metabolites as intracellular biomarkers only (tryptophan) or as both intra and extracellular biomarkers (e.g. 2-methylbutyric acid and ketoleucine). © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Besides the performance of water treatments on the removal of micropollutants, concern about the generation of potential biologically active transformation products has been growing. Thus, the detection and structural elucidation of micropollutants transformation products have turned out to be major issues to evaluate comprehensively the efficiency of the processes implemented for drinking water treatment. However, most of existing water treatment studies are carried out at the bench scale with high concentrations and simplified conditions and thus do not reflect realistic conditions. Conversely, this study describes a non-targeted profiling approach borrowed from metabolomic science, using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry, in order to reveal potential chlorination products of bisphenol A (BPA) in real water samples spiked at 50μgL-1. Targeted measurements first evidenced a fast removal of BPA (&gt;99%) by chlorination with sodium hypochlorite (0.8mgL-1) within 10min. Then, the developed differential global profiling approach enabled to reveal 21 chlorination products of BPA. Among them, 17 were brominated compounds, described for the first time, demonstrating the potential interest of this innovative methodology applied to environmental sciences. In parallel to the significant removal of BPA, the estrogenic activity of water samples, evaluated by ER-CALUX assay, was found to significantly decrease after 10min of chlorination. These results confirm that chlorination is effective at removing BPA in drinking water and they may indicate that the generated compounds have significantly lower estrogenic activity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Lipids represent an extended class of substances characterized by such high variety and complexity that makes their unified analyses by liquid chromatography coupled to either high resolution or tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS or LC-MS/MS) a real challenge. In the present study, a new versatile methodology associating ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS/MS) have been developed for a comprehensive analysis of lipids. The use of polarity switching and "all ion fragmentation" (AIF) have been two action levels particularly exploited to finally permit the detection and identification of a multi-class and multi-analyte extended range of lipids in a single run. For identification purposes, both higher energy collision dissociation (HCD) and in-source CID (collision induced dissociation) fragmentation were evaluated in order to obtain information about the precursor and product ions in the same spectra. This approach provides both class-specific and lipid-specific fragments, enhancing lipid identification. Finally, the developed method was applied for differential phenotyping of serum samples collected from pet dogs developing spontaneous malignant mammary tumors and health controls. A biological signature associated with the presence of cancer was then successfully revealed from this lipidome analysis, which required to be further investigated and confirmed at larger scale. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The steroid hormone 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is one of the most physiologically important androgens in male vertebrates, with the exception of teleost fish, in which it is generally assumed that DHT does not play any major physiological role. However, this assumption is challenged by the fact that all the components involved in DHT biosynthesis and action are present and evolutionary conserved in teleost fish. In fact, testosterone (T) is converted into DHT by two isoforms of the enzyme steroid-5-alpha-reductase (5αR), and both 5αRs gene expression and enzymatic activity have been detected in several tissues of different teleost species, which also have an androgen receptor with high binding affinity to DHT. This body of evidence strongly suggest that DHT is synthesised by teleost fish. We investigated this hypothesis using the cyprinid fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) as the experimental model. The study of the evolutionary and functional conservation of 5αRs in teleost fish was used to support the experimental approach, based on an ultrasensitive gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) method to identify and measure simultaneously T and DHT in fathead minnow biological fluids and tissues. The analyses were performed using plasma samples collected from both male and female adult fish and samples of testicular tissue collected from sexually mature males. Both T and DHT were identified and quantified in all the samples analysed, and in particular, the high concentrations of DHT quantified in the testes suggested that these organs are a likely site of synthesis of DHT in the teleost fathead minnow, as they are in mammals. These results may represent the basis for future studies aimed at elucidating the physiological role, if any, of DHT in teleost fish. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This study aimed to determine the kinetics of contamination and decontamination of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in milk of lactating goats. Four goats were fed during 39 days with corn silage collected in an area accidentally contaminated and then with uncontaminated silage during 20 days. Concentrations of DL-PCBs + PCDD/Fs in milk exceeded rapidly (<15 days) the European limit value and approached steady state after 5 weeks. The decontamination kinetics in milk included first a rapid elimination phase (<10 days) followed by a slower elimination phase of 33, 51, and 59 days for DL-PCBs, NDL-PCBs, and PCDD/Fs, respectively. Therefore, in lactating goats, PCBs and PCDD/Fs contaminated forage raises concerns in terms of food safety. The study also indicates that a decontamination process of lactating animals remains feasible; 20 days was considered to be sufficient to obtain a DL-PCBs + PCDD/Fs level in milk below the regulatory value. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Metabolomics has been emerging for several years as a global chemical phenotyping approach offering fascinating descriptive capabilities for addressing life complexity. It facilitates the understanding of the mechanisms of biological and biochemical processes in complex systems and promises new insights into specific research questions. The objective of this study was to use for the first time a metabolomic approach based on liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry for characterizing an alteration of the testicular function, namely impaired semen quality. Metabolomic fingerprints were generated from serum samples collected from Danish young men presenting low, intermediate, or high sperm concentrations. Serum metabolic profiles were found to be significantly different among the three groups of volunteers. The developed methodology permitted to correlate the studied clinical parameter (i.e., sperm concentration) with the metabolite profiles generated. Peptides related to the Protein Complement C3f were identified as putative markers associated with this clinical parameter. The biological interpretation and further robustness linked to this observation remain to be further investigated, in particular to address the inter- and intraindividual variabilities. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={To assess the global effect of preterm birth on fetal metabolism and maternal-fetal nutrient transfer, we used a mass spectrometric-based chemical phenotyping approach on cord blood obtained at the time of birth. We sampled umbilical venous, umbilical arterial, and maternal blood from mothers delivering very-low birth weight (VLBW, with a median gestational age and weight of 29 weeks, and 1210 g, respectively) premature or full-term (FT) neonates. In VLBW group, we observed a significant elevation in the levels and maternal-fetal gradients of butyryl-, isovaleryl-, hexanoyl- and octanoyl-carnitines, suggesting enhanced short- and medium chain fatty acid β-oxidation in human preterm feto-placental unit. The significant decrease in glutamine-glutamate in preterm arterial cord blood beside lower levels of amino acid precursors of Krebs cycle suggest increased glutamine utilization in the fast growing tissues of preterm fetus with a deregulation in placental glutamate-glutamine shuttling. Enhanced glutathione utilization is likely to account for the decrease in precursor amino acids (serine, betaine, glutamate and methionine) in arterial cord blood. An increase in both the circulating levels and maternal-fetal gradients of several polyamines in their acetylated form (diacetylspermine and acetylputrescine) suggests an enhanced polyamine metabolic cycling in extreme prematurity. Our metabolomics study allowed the identification of alterations in fetal energy, antioxidant defense, and polyamines and purines flux as a signature of premature birth. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={For a few years, the concern of water treatment companies is not only focused on the removal of target micropollutants but has been extended to the investigation of potential biologically active by-products generated during the treatment processes. Therefore, some methods dedicated to the detection and structural characterization of such by-products have emerged. However, most of these studies are usually carried out under simplified conditions (e.g. high concentration levels of micropollutants, drastic treatment conditions, use of deionized or ultrapure water) and somewhat unrealistic conditions compared to that implemented in water treatment plants. In the present study, a real field water sample was fortified at the part-per-billion level (50μgL-1) with estrone-3-sulfate (E1-3S) before being ozonated (at 1mgL-1) for 10min. In a first step, targeted measurements evidenced a degradation of the parent compound (&gt;80%) in 10min. Secondly, a non-targeted chemical profiling approach derived from metabolomic profiling studies allowed to reveal 11 ozonation by-products, among which 4 were found predominant. The estrogenic activity of these water samples spiked with E1-3S before and after treatment was assessed by the ER-CALUX assay and was found to decrease significantly after 10min of ozonation. Therefore, this innovative methodological strategy demonstrated its suitability and relevancy for revealing unknown compounds generated from water treatment, and permitted to generate new results regarding specifically the impact of ozonation on estrone-3-sulfate. These results confirm that ozonation is effective at removing E1-3S in drinking water and indicate that the by-products generated have significantly lower estrogenic activity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Glucocorticoids constitute a class of molecules widely used in animal husbandry. Some of these compounds are licensed for veterinary practices while their use for growth promoting purposes is prohibited within the European Union. In order to ensure the respect of the legislation and consumers safety, several methodologies have been proposed to monitor these substances in various products, including edible matrices for which a regulatory limit has been set up (MRL). An extended range of targeted analytes together with reduced time of analysis and cost are however still current challenges regularly revisited according to the continuous technological improvements. In this context, the aim of the present study was to develop and implement a new fast and multi-residue method based on UHPLC-MS/MS for the determination of twenty glucocorticoids in bovine milk, included the screening of the three regulated MRL compounds (dexamethasone, betamethasone and prednisolone). This validated method authorises such multi-analyte measurement within a 10min runtime while the signal specificity is ensured through the SRM acquisition mode. Decision limits and detection capabilities were calculated in the range of 0.001-0.363μgL-1, which allows a very efficient control at low trace level for a potential illegal use of these substances. The performances obtained in terms of application range, selectivity and sensitivity were found to be significantly improved in comparison to other reported approaches either for screening or confirmation purposes: regarding linearity, correlation coefficients were above 0.98 within the range of 0.01-5.0μgL-1, repeatability and reproducibility parameters ranged from 1 to 30% with the maximum relative standard deviation (RSD) observed for cortisone (30.1%). Stability of the stock solutions and minor changes in the standard operating procedure have been included for the determination of ruggedness of the method. Identification was systematically ensured according to 4 identification points, RSD of transitions ratio (T2/T1) ranged from 3.2% and 19.3% and the RSD of the retention time was lower than 0.25%. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The efficiency of the administration of recombinant bovine growth hormone (rbGH) to enhance fish growth has been widely reported in the literature. Although its use is probable and has been described in several countries, rbGH is prohibited in the European Union (Council Decisions 1994/936/EC, 1999/879/EC). In this context, an analytical strategy was optimised in order to identify rbGH-treated fish. Currently, one of the most difficult challenges for the detection of rbGH in fish is probably the choice of the matrix and the corresponding available quantity for analysis. Therefore, based on a previous efficient protocol developed for mammalian species, a method was adapted for very limited serum volume (50 μl) and was successfully implemented to analyse serum collected from seven trout treated with rbGH. The detection of rbGH was possible from the very first day after administration and the hormone could easily be identified at least for 1 month with levels in the range 5-10 μg ml-1. The limits of detection (LODs) estimated around 0.5 μg ml-1 rbGH in fish serum are far below observed concentrations in incurred samples and therefore attest to the relevance of the developed protocol. © 2013 Copyright Taylor &amp; Francis.},

abstract={There is an increasing need of new bio-analytical methodologies with enough sensitivity, robustness and resolution to cope with the analysis of a large number of analytes in complex matrices in short analysis time. For this purpose, all steps included in any bio-analytical method (sampling, extraction, clean-up, chromatographic analysis and detection) must be taken into account to achieve good and reliable results with cost-effective methodologies. The purpose of this review is to describe the state-of-the-art of the most employed technologies in the period 2009-2012 to achieve fast analysis with liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methodologies for bio-analytical applications. Current trends in fast liquid chromatography involve the use of several column technologies and this review will focus on the two most frequently applied: sub-2. μm particle size packed columns to achieve ultra high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) separations and porous-shell particle packed columns to attain high efficiency separations with reduced column back-pressures. Additionally, recent automated sample extraction and clean-up methodologies to reduce sample manipulation, variability and total analysis time in bio-analytical applications such as on-line solid phase extraction coupled to HPLC or UHPLC methods, or the use of other approaches such as molecularly imprinted polymers, restricted access materials, and turbulent flow chromatography will also be addressed. The use of mass spectrometry and high or even ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry to reduce sample manipulation and to solve ion suppression or ion enhancement and matrix effects will also be presented. The advantages and drawbacks of all these methodologies for fast and sensitive analysis of biological samples are going to be discussed by means of relevant applications. © 2013 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={A previously developed and validated methodology based on liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry was used for determine the concentration levels of 14 perfluoroalkylated substances (PFASs) in a set of 48 breast milk samples collected from French women in the frame of the ELFE pilot study. In accordance with other similar studies conducted at european and international levels, PFOS, PFOA, and PFHxS were detected and quantified in most of the analyzed samples (90%, 98% and 100%, respectively), and appeared as major contributors to the total PFAS exposure (38%, 37%, 25%, respectively), whereas the other targeted PFAS were very rarely, if not, found at the limits of detection of the method. Also in agreement with other published data, the concentration levels measured for the detected substances varied from <0.05 to 0.33 μg/L for PFOS (median=0.079), from <0.05 to 0.22 μg/L for PFOA (median=0.075), and from 0.04 to 0.07 μg/L for PFHxS (median=0.050). On the basis of this relatively limited data set, no statistically significant relation was observed between these exposure levels and developmental outcomes, in particular the weight at birth. Similarly, no relation was observed between the measured PFAS levels and various socio-demographical parameters including the consumption of seafood, alcohol, smoking, or socio-economical level. These results suggest a need for further research and better knowledge regarding the sources, pharmacokinetics, and factors of exposure for other substances belonging to this class of emerging contaminants. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Although substantial technical advances have been achieved during the past decades to extend and facilitate the analysis of growth promoters in cattle, the detection of abuse of synthetic analogs of naturally occurring hormones has remained a challenging issue. When it became clear that the exogenous origin of steroid hormones could be traced based on the 13C/12C isotope ratio of the substances, GC/C/IRMS has been successfully implemented to this aim since the end of the past century. However, due to the costly character of the instrumental setup, the susceptibility of the equipment to errors and the complex and time consuming sample preparation, this method is up until now only applied by a limited number of laboratories. In this review, the general principles as well as the practical application of GC/C/IRMS to differentiate between endogenous steroids and exogenously synthesized homologous compounds in cattle will be discussed in detail, and will be placed next to other existing and to be developed methods based on isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Finally, the link will be made with the field of sports doping, where GC/C/IRMS has been established within the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) approved methods as the official technique to differentiate between exogenous and endogenous steroids over the past few years. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={During last decades, the use of natural steroids in racing and food producing animals for doping purposes has been flourishing. The endogenous or exogenous origin of these naturally occurring steroids has since remained a challenge for the different anti-doping laboratories. The administration of these substances to animals is usually made through an intra-muscular pathway with the steroid under its ester form for a higher bioavailability and a longer lasting effect. Detecting these steroid esters would provide an unequivocal proof of an exogenous administration of the considered naturally occurring steroids. A quick analytical method able to detect at trace level (below 50. pg/mL) a large panel of more than 20 steroid esters in serum and plasma potentially used for doping purposes in bovine and equine has been developed. Following a pre-treatment step, the sample is submitted to a solid phase extraction (SPE) before analysis with UPLC-MS/MS. The analytical method's efficiency has been probed through three different in vivo experiments involving testosterone propionate intra-muscular administration to three heifers, 17-estradiol benzoate intra-muscular administration to a bull and a heifer and nandrolone laurate intra-muscular administration to a stallion. The results enabled detecting the injected testosterone propionate and 17-estradiol benzoate 2 and 17 days, respectively, post-administration in bovine and nandrolone laurate up to 14 days post-administration in equine. The corresponding elimination profiles in bovine serum and equine plasma have been established. The first bovine experiment exhibited a maximal testosterone propionate concentration of 400. pg/mL in one of the three heifer serum within 5. h post-administration. The second bovine experiment reported a maximal 17-estradiol benzoate concentration of 480. pg/mL in the same matrix recorded 9 days after its administration. The last equine experiment resulted in a maximal nandrolone laurate concentration of 440. pg/mL in horse plasma 24. h after administration. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The levels and congener patterns of HBCDs (hexabromocyclododecanes) and PFCs (perfluorinated compounds) were determined in filter-feeding molluscs collected in 2008 and 2010 along the coasts of mainland France. α-HBCD and PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonate) were detected in all samples, revealing widespread contamination of the coastal environment by these emerging contaminants. The spatial distribution of Σ-HBCD concentrations showed higher median levels in samples from the Mediterranean Sea and English Channel respectively, i.e. 0.19ngg-1 wet weight (ww) and 0.08ngg-1 ww, related to high anthropogenic pressure from urban and industrial activities, while the median concentration was 0.05ngg-1 ww in samples from the Atlantic coast. Among PFCs, PFOS was the only compound detected in all samples and PFDA (perfluorodecanoic acid) was the second most frequently-detected compound. PFOS median concentrations were 0.18ngg-1 ww, 0.09ngg-1 ww and 0.04ngg-1 ww in samples from the English Channel, the Atlantic coast and the Mediterranean coast respectively. The highest PFOS concentration was found in the Loire estuary, possibly related to local industrial activities. The Mediterranean samples showed a different pattern, with predominant long-chain PFCAs (perfluorocarboxylic acids), suggesting the presence of alternative sources on the Mediterranean coast. The temporal trends studied in archived samples from the Seine estuary site showed a significant exponential increase in HBCD concentrations between 1981 and 2011, with a doubling time of 7. years, while PFOS levels underwent a significant linear decrease over time. These trends are coherent with current regulations on the use of these compounds. The results presented in this paper provide the first data on the contamination of the French coastal marine environment by the selected emerging compounds, and constitute a reference for the future monitoring of French coastal contamination by emerging contaminants. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Study Question: Is exposure to perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) associated with testicular function (reproductive hormone levels and semen quality) in healthy men? Summary Answer: PFOS levels were significantly negatively associated with serum testosterone (total and calculated free), but not with any other reproductive hormones or semen quality. What is Known Already: In animals, some PFCs have endocrine disrupting potential, but few studies have investigated PFCs in relation to human testicular function. Previously, we and others have observed a negative association between serum PFC levels and sperm morphology. The potential associations with reproductive hormones remain largely unresolved. Study Design , Size, Duration A cross-sectional study of 247 men was conducted during 2008-2009. Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods Healthy men from the general population, median age of 19 years, gave serum and semen samples. Serum samples were analysed for total testosterone (T), estradiol (E), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and inhibin-B and 14 PFCs, including perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS). Semen samples were analysed according to the WHO criteria. Main Results and the Role of Chance: PFOS levels were negatively associated with testosterone (T), calculated free testosterone (FT), free androgen index (FAI) and ratios of T/LH, FAI/LH and FT/LH. Other PFCs were found at lower levels than PFOS and did not exhibit the same associations. PFC levels were not significantly associated with semen quality. PFOS levels in these samples collected in 2008-2009 were lower than in our previous study of men participating in 2003. Limitations, Reasons For Caution Results were robust to adjustment for relevant confounders; however, the possibility of chance associations due to multiple testing or effects of uncontrolled confounding cannot be ruled out. Wider Implications of the Finding: s: Our previous findings of decreased sperm morphology in the most highly PFC exposed men were not replicated, possibly due to a lack of highly exposed individuals; however, a recent independent study also did corroborate such an inverse association. The negative association between serum PFOS and testosterone indicates that testosterone production may be compromised in individuals with high PFOS exposure.

abstract={Background: A dipose tissue (AT) is involved in several physiological functions, including metabolic regulation, energy storage, and endocrine functions. Objectives: In this review we examined the evidence that an additional function of AT is to modulate persistent organic pollutant (POP) toxicity through several mechanisms. Methods: We reviewed the literature on the interaction of AT with POPs to provide a comprehensive model for this additional function of AT. discussion: As a storage compartment for lipophilic POPs, AT plays a critical role in the toxico-kinetics of a variety of drugs and pollutants, in particular, POPs. By sequestering POPs, AT can protect other organs and tissues from POPs overload. However, this protective function could prove to be a threat in the long run. Te accumulation of lipophilic POPs will increase total body burden. These accumulated POPs are slowly released into the bloodstream, and more so during weight loss. Thus, AT constitutes a continual source of internal exposure to POPs. In addition to its buffering function, AT is also a target of POPs and may mediate part of their metabolic effects. This is particularly relevant because many POPs induce obesogenic effects that may lead to quantitative and qualitative alterations of AT. Some POPs also induce a proinflammatory state in AT, which may lead to detrimental metabolic effects. Conclusion: AT appears to play diverse functions both as a modulator and as a target of POPs toxicity.},

abstract={In recent decades, many toxicological tests based on in vivo or in vitro models, mainly from mammalian (rat-mouse) and fish species, were used to assess the risks raised by contact or ingestion of molecules of pharmaceutical, agricultural, or natural origin. But no, or few, in vitro tests using other non-mammalian models such as bird have been explored despite their advantages: the embryonic gonads of birds have a high plasticity of development sensitive to estrogen, and sperm production is nearly two times faster than in rodents. Hence, we have established an in vitro culture of germ cells and somatic cells from chicken post-natal testis, and we have evaluated the sensitivity against the endocrine disruptor compound mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) in comparison to previous studies using rodent and human models. After 96 h of exposure in presence of 10 μM MEHP, chicken seminiferous tubules cultures present a structural alteration, a reduction in cell proliferation and in germ cells population. Apoptosis of germ and somatic cells increases in presence of 1 μM MEHP. Furthermore, MEHP does not affect inhibin B and lactate production by Sertoli cells. These results are in accordance with previous studies using rat, mice, or human culture of testicular cells and in similar range of exposures or even better sensitivity for some "end-points" (biological parameters). In conclusion, the establishment of this postnatal testicular cells culture could be considered as an alternative method to in vivo experiments frequently used for evaluating the impact on the terrestrial wildlife species. This method could be also complementary to mammal model due to the limiting number of animals used and its elevated sensitivity. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The administration of recombinant methionyl bovine somatotropin (rMbST) to dairy cows to increase milk yield remains a common practice in many countries including the USA, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa and Korea, whereas it has been forbidden within the European Union (EU) since 1999. A rapid screening immunoanalytical method capable of the unequivocal determination of rMbST in milk would be highly desirable in order to effectively monitor compliance with the EU-wide ban for home-made or imported dairy products. For decades, the production of specific antibodies for this recombinant isoform of bovine somatotropin (bST) has remained elusive, due to the high degree of sequence homology between both counterparts (e.g. methionine for rMbST in substitution of alanine in bST at the N-terminus). In this study, we compared several immunizing strategies for the production of specific polyclonal antibodies (pAbs), based on the use of the full-length recombinant protein, an rMbST N-terminus peptide fragment and a multiple antigen peptide (MAP) which consists of an oligomeric branching lysine core attached to the first two N-terminus amino acids of rMbST, methionine and phenylalanine (MF-MAP). The immunization with KLH-conjugated MF-MAP led to the production of the pAb with the highest rMbST/bST recognition ratio amongst the generated battery of antibodies. The pAb exhibited a specific binding ability to rMbST in a competitive antigen-coated ELISA format, which avidity was further improved after purification by rMbST N-terminus peptide-based affinity chromatography. These results suggest that immunodiscrimination between structurally related proteins can be achieved using immuno-enhanced immunogens such as MAPs. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In the frame of the second French Total Diet Study (TDS), the 15 + 1 EU priority polycyclic aromatics hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed in 725 foodstuffs habitually consumed by the French population, using gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, after pressurized liquid extraction and purification on PS-DVB stationary phase. The highest PAH concentrations recovered in foodstuffs corresponded to the following contributors: chrysene (25.7%), benzo[b]fluoranthene (15.0%) and benz[a]anthracene (9.0%) whereas the lowest concentrations were those of dibenz[a,h]anthracene, 5 methylchrysene and dibenzo[a,h]pyrene (below 2.0%). By food groups, the current highest levels of total PAH were detected in mollusks and crustaceans, followed by the different oil based products. To estimate French population's exposure, contamination data were combined with national individual food consumption data. Mean daily exposure to the sum of benzo[a]pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, chrysene and benzo[b]fluoranthene (PAH4) was estimated to be 1.48. ng/kg. bw/day in adults and 2.26. ng/kg. bw/day in children. The main contributors to PAH exposure for adults are fats, bread and dried bread products followed by crustaceans and mollusks. The margin of exposure (MOE) approach indicates that exposure to PAHs through food is not a major health problem for French consumers. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Due to their widespread diffusion, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been frequently found in the environment and in several animal species. It has been demonstrated that they can easily reach also humans, mainly through diet. Being lactation a major route of elimination of these contaminants, their occurrence in human milk is of particular interest, especially considering that it generally represents the unique food source for newborns. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), the two most important compounds of this family, have been frequently found in human milk at variable concentrations, but still limited data are available. The present study, the first conducted in Italy capable to detect these pollutants at ultra-trace levels by UPLC-MS/MS, confirmed the role of lactation as a relevant source of exposure for breastfed children. The measured concentrations ranged between 15 and 288 ng/L for PFOS and between 24 and 241 ng/L for PFOA. Moreover, mean concentrations and frequencies of both analytes resulted higher in milk samples provided by primiparous women, suggesting that the risk of intake might be higher for first-borns. Finally, comparing these results with previous data, PFOS gradual decrease over time since year 2000 was confirmed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Metabolic fingerprints differed significantly over time. Forty-five metabolites were identified, including well-known cheese metabolites, such as 12 amino acids and 25 volatile metabolites, and less studied ones, such as four vitamins, uric acid, creatine and L-carnitine.

abstract={The use of anabolic substances to promote growth in livestock is prohibited within the European Union as laid down in Directive 96/22/EC. Nowadays, efficient methods such as steroid profiling or isotopic deviation measurements allow to control natural steroid hormones abuse. In both cases, urine is often selected as the most relevant matrix and, due to its relatively high content of potential interferents, its preparation before analysis is considered as a key step. In this context, the use of a selective sorbent such as molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was investigated. A MIP was synthesized based on 17β-estradiol, methacrylic acid and acetonitrile as template, monomer and porogen, respectively. Two approaches were then tested for non-conjugated (aglycons and glucuronides deconjugated) steroid purification: (i) molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction (MISPE) and (ii) semi-preparative supercritical fluid chromatography with a commercial MIP as stationary phase (SFC-MIP). Parameters for both approaches were optimized based on the main bovine metabolites of testosterone, estradiol, nandrolone and boldenone. The MISPE protocol developed for screening purposes allowed satisfactory recoveries (upper 65% for the 12 target steroids) with sufficient purification for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. For confirmatory purposes, the use of isotopic ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) requires a higher degree of purity of the target compounds, which can be reached by the SFC-MIP protocol with three steps less compared to the official and current method. Purity, concentration and absence of isotopic fractionation of target steroids extracted from urine of treated cattle (treated with testosterone, estradiol, androstenedione, and boldenone) allowed the measurement of 13C/12C isotopic ratios of corresponding metabolites and endogenous reference compounds (ERC) and proved the relevance of the strategy. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The 2006 european directive on polychlorodibenzodioxins and related compounds in foodstuffs prompted in France a nationwide monitoring study of freshwater fish contamination by these compounds. A database covering about 300 sites (2848 samples of 36 fish species) was obtained from this study. This database was used to explore congener pattern distributions, in order to identify typical sources and the impact of biotransformation on these sources. Fish ecological traits and fish size are the main factors explaining the overall PCB contamination in the two pre-identified categories of species (high or low propensity to accumulate hydrophobic compounds). Lipid content is also an influencing factor, but its relationship to other factors remains uncertain. Species show distinct congener patterns, related more to their physiology than to ecological traits. Spatial patterns were studied on selected sites having more than five individuals analysed - either chub (Squalius cephalus) or barbel (Barbus barbus), the most widespread species in the database -. We identified six patterns, which mainly differed in the respective proportions of congeners potentially biotransformed by fish. No connection to typical sources, e.g. technical mixtures, was identified. These patterns instead represent an ageing path of the initial mixtures; they could be used for setting remediation priorities. © ONEMA, 2013.},

abstract={The current investigations were carried out in the context of a nutritional case study aiming at assessing the postnatal impact of maternal dietary protein restriction during pregnancy and lactation on rat offspring plasma metabolome and hypothalamic proteome. Although data generated by different "Omics" technologies are usually considered and analyzed separately, their interrelation may offer a valuable opportunity for assessing the emerging 'integrated biology' concept. The overall strategy of analysis first investigated data pretreatment and variable selection for each dataset. Then, three multivariate analyses were applied to investigate the links between the abundance of metabolites and the expression of proteins collected on the same samples. Unfold principal component analysis and regularized canonical correlation analysis did not take into account the presence of groups of individuals related to the intervention study. On the contrary, the predictive MultiBlock Partial Least Squares method used this information. Regularized canonical correlation analysis appeared as a relevant approach to investigate of the relationships between the two datasets. However, in order to highlight the molecular compounds, proteins and metabolites, associated in interacting or common metabolic pathways for the experimental groups, MultiBlock partial least squares was the most appropriate method in the present nutritional case study. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Metabolomics aims at detecting and semi-quantifying small molecular weight metabolites in biological samples in order to characterise the metabolic changes resulting from one or more given factors and/or to develop models based on diagnostic biomarker candidates. Nevertheless, whatever the objective of a metabolomic study, one critical step consists in the structural identification of mass spectrometric features revealed by statistical analysis and this remains a real challenge. Indeed, this requires both an understanding of the studied biological system, the correct use of various analytical information (retention time, molecular weight experimentally measured, isotopic golden rules, MS/MS fragment pattern interpretation...), or querying online databases. In gas chromatography-electro-ionisation (EI)-mass spectrometry, EI leads to a very reproducible fragmentation allowing establishment of universal EI mass spectra databases (for example, the NIST database - National Institute of Standards and Technology) and thus facilitates the identification step. Unfortunately, the situation is different when working with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) since atmospheric pressure ionisation exhibits high inter-instrument variability regarding fragmentation. Therefore, the constitution of LC-MS "in-house" spectral databases appears relevant in this context. The present study describes the procedure developed and applied to increment 133 and 130 metabolites in databanks dedicated to analyses performed with LC-HRMS in positive and negative electrospray ionisation, and the use of these databanks for annotating quickly untargeted metabolomics fingerprints. This study also describes the optimization of the parameters controlling the automatic processing in order to obtain a fast and reliable annotation of a maximum of organic compounds. This strategy was applied to bovine kidney samples collected from control animals or animals treated with steroid hormones. Thirty-eight compounds were identified successfully in the generated chemical phenotypes, among which five were found to be candidate markers of the administration of these anabolic agents, demonstrating the efficiency of the developed strategy to reveal and confirm metabolite structures according to the high-throughput objective expected from these integrative biological approaches. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={The main objective of this study was to collect new data on the occurrence, levels of priority and emerging organic compounds in freshwater fish sampled in the Rhone River. The 34 studied contaminants included alkylphenols, bisphenol A, polybromodiphenylethers (PBDE), perfluorinated compounds, hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCD), hexachlorobenzene and hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD). About 50 fish samples (individual specimens or pooled fish) were collected from three sites located upstream and downstream of the Lyon metropolitan area in the Rhone River (France). Four species were caught at each site, namely: the barbel (Barbus barbus), the common bream (Abramis brama), the white bream (Blicca bjoerkna) and the chub (Squalius cephalus). Some contaminants were quantified in all the 32 fish samples analysed: 4-nonylphenol, α-HBCD, the six PBDE congeners (28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorodecanoic acid. Twenty three of the 32 samples had a concentration of PFOS above the Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) (up to six times higher than the EQS), and all the 32 samples had concentrations of PBDE above the EQS (up to 4,000 times higher, with the sum of six PBDE varying from 4.5 to 182 ng/g dry weight). Clearly, the interest to consider PFOS and HBCD as new priority substances is confirmed. In contrast, the pertinence of a priority status for HCBD, which was never quantified in our study, might have to be reconsidered in the future. © Springer-Verlag 2012.},

abstract={After a conditioning period, seed dormancy in obligate root parasitic plants is released by a chemical stimulus secreted by the roots of host plants. Using Phelipanche ramosa as the model, experiments conducted in this study showed that seeds require a conditioning period of at least 4 d to be receptive to the synthetic germination stimulant GR24. A cDNA-AFLP procedure on seeds revealed 58 transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) whose expression pattern changed upon GR24 treatment. Among the isolated TDFs, two up-regulated sequences corresponded to an abscisic acid (ABA) catabolic gene, PrCYP707A1, encoding an ABA 8'-hydroxylase. Using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends method, two full-length cDNAs, PrCYP707A1 and PrCYP707A2, were isolated from seeds. Both genes were always expressed at low levels during conditioning during which an initial decline in ABA levels was recorded. GR24 application after conditioning triggered a strong up-regulation of PrCYP707A1 during the first 18h, followed by an 8-fold decrease in ABA levels detectable 3 d after treatment. In situ hybridization experiments on GR24-treated seeds revealed a specific PrCYP707A1 mRNA accumulation in the cells located between the embryo and the micropyle. Abz-E2B, a specific inhibitor of CYP707A enzymes, significantly impeded seed germination, proving to be a non-competitive antagonist of GR24 with reversible inhibitory activity. These results demonstrate that P. ramosa seed dormancy release relies on ABA catabolism mediated by the GR24-dependent activation of PrCYP707A1. In addition, in situ hybridization corroborates the putative location of cells receptive to the germination stimulants in seeds. © [2012] The Author.},

abstract={Metabolomics is a science of interest in food analysis to describe and predict properties of food products and processes. It includes the development of analytical methods with the ultimate goal being the identification of so-called 'quality markers', (i.e. sets of metabolites that correlate with, for example, quality, safety, taste, or fragrance of foodstuffs). In turn, these metabolites are influenced by factors as genetic differences of the raw food ingredients (such as animal breed or crop species differences), growth conditions (such as climate, irrigation strategy, or feeding) or production conditions (such as temperature, acidity, or pressure). In cases where the routine-based measurement of a food property faces some limitations such as the lack of knowledge regarding the target compounds to monitor, monitoring based on a limited set of crucial biomarkers is a good alternative, which is of great interest for food safety purposes regarding growth promoting practices. Such an approach may be more efficient than using a classic approach based on a limited set of known metabolites of anabolic compounds. In this context, screening strategies allowing detection of the physiological response resulting from anabolic compound administration are promising approaches to detect their misuse. The global metabolomics workflow implemented for such studies is presented and illustrated through various examples of biological matrices profiling (tissue, blood, urine) and for different classes of anabolic compounds (steroids, β-agonists and somatotropin). © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Detection of the abuse of synthetic steroids in food production is nowadays relatively straightforward using modern techniques such as gas or liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS or LC-MS/MS, respectively). However, proving the abuse of 'endogenous' (or naturally occurring) steroids is more difficult. Despite these difficulties, significant progress in this area has recently been made and a number of methods are now available. The aim of the current review was to systematically review the available analytical approaches, which include threshold concentrations, qualitative 'marker' metabolites, intact steroid esters, gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS), longitudinal testing and 'omics' biomarker profiling. The advantages/disadvantages of these methods are considered in detail, but the choice of which to adopt is dictated by a number of practical, political, and economic factors, which vary in different parts of the world. These include the steroid/species combination requiring analysis, the matrix tested, whether samples are collected from live or slaughtered animals, available analytical instrumentation, sample throughput/cost, and the relevant legal/regulatory frameworks. Furthermore, these approaches could be combined in a range of different parallel and/or sequential screening/confirmatory testing streams, with the final choice being determined by the aforementioned considerations. Despite these advances, more work is required to refine the different techniques and to respond to the ever increasing list of compounds classified as 'endogenous'. At this advanced stage, however, it is now more important than ever for scientists and regulators from across the world to communicate and collaborate in order to harmonize and streamline research efforts. © Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.},

abstract={Phelipanche ramosa is a major parasitic weed of Brassica napus. The first step in a host-parasitic plant interaction is stimulation of parasite seed germination by compounds released from host roots. However, germination stimulants produced by B. napus have not been identified yet. In this study, we characterized the germination stimulants that accumulate in B. napus roots and are released into the rhizosphere. Eight glucosinolate-breakdown products were identified and quantified in B. napus roots by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Two (3-phenylpropanenitrile and 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate [2-PEITC]) were identified in the B. napus rhizosphere. Among glucosinolatebreakdown products, P. ramosa germination was strongly and specifically triggered by isothiocyanates, indicating that 2-PEITC, in particular, plays a key role in the B. napus - P. ramosa interaction. Known strigolactones were not detected by ultraperformance liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry, and seed of Phelipanche and Orobanche spp. that respond to strigolactones but not to isothiocyanates did not germinate in the rhizosphere of B. napus. Furthermore, both wild-type and strigolactone biosynthesis mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana Atccd7 and Atccd8 induced similar levels of P. ramosa seed germination, suggesting that compounds other than strigolactone function as germination stimulants for P. ramosa in other Brassicaceae spp. Our results open perspectives on the high adaptation potential of root-parasitic plants under host-driven selection pressures. © 2012 The American Phytopathological Society.},

abstract={Transfer of indicator polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) from soil into hen eggs may occur in hens reared outdoor, which ingest significant amounts of soil. This transfer depends on the bioavailability of the ingested compounds. The impact of soil on the bioavailability of indicator PCBs was assessed by means by a relative bioavailability (RBA) trial, in which their deposition in egg yolk and in abdominal fat, in response to their ingestion through contaminated-soil and through spiked-oil were compared. A sandy soil (709μg indicator PCBskg -1 dry matter) was collected in the vicinity of a former fire involving treated wood. Twenty-eight laying hens were individually housed and fed one of the seven experimental diets during 14d. The seven experimental diets were an uncontaminated control diet, three diets in which contaminated soil was introduced at levels of 3%, 6% and 9% and three diets in which spiked oil was introduced to achieve similar levels and profile of contaminants. Yolk, abdominal fat and liver were collected at the end of exposure. Indicator PCBs were extracted by ASE (Accelerated Solvent Extraction) and analyzed by GC-HMRS. Within each ingested matrix, the concentration of indicator PCBs in yolk and in abdominal fat linearly increased with the amount of indicator PCB ingested (P&lt;0.001). Except for PCB 28, the slopes of the responses to soil and to oil could not be differentiated (P&gt;0.1). RBA estimates did not differ from 1 for all indicator PCBs except for PCB 28, for which it was 0.58-0.59. Measurements performed on liver confirm these conclusions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Thyreostatic drugs, illegally administrated to livestock for fattening purposes, are banned in the European Union since 1981. For monitoring their illegal use, sensitive and specific analytical methods are required. In this context, the knowledge of the stability in a matrix is of primary importance. This study aimed at evaluating the effects of preservation, number of freeze-thaw cycles, and matrixrelated variables on the stability of thyreostatic drugs in the urine of livestock. Finally, the developed conservation approach was applied on incurred urine samples, which displayed traces of the thyreostat thiouracil below the recommended concentration of 10 μg L?1. The stability study confirmed the negative influence of preservation (8 h) at room temperature and at ?70 °C, decreases in concentration of more than 78.0% were observed for all thyreostats, except for 1- methyl-2-mercaptoimidazole and 2-mercaptobenzimidazole. Additionally, investigation of matrix-related variables indicated significant impacts of the presence of copper (p0 0.001) and the pH (p00.002). Next, an optimised pretreatment (pH 1 and 0.1 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt dehydrate) significantly differing from the original conservation approach (p&lt;0.05) was developed, which proved capable of delaying the decrease in concentration and improved the detection in time for both spiked as well as incurred urine samples. In the future, it seems highly advisable to apply the developed pre-treatment on incurred urines upon sampling, before thyreostat analysis. Additionally, it is recommendable to limit preservation of urine samples at room temperature, but also in the freezer prior to thyreostat analysis.© 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) bioaccumulate through the food chain and are therefore of public health concern. Exposure to these compounds was assessed in the second French Total Diet Study (TDS). Food samples (n= 583) were collected to be representative of the whole diet of the population, prepared as consumed, and analyzed. Contamination data were combined with national individual food consumption data.Mean exposure (95th percentile) to PCDD/F+DL-PCBs was assessed to be 0.57 (1.29)pgTEQWHO-98(kgbw)-1d-1 in the adult population and 0.89 (2.02)pgTEQWHO-98(kgbw)-1d-1 in the child and teenager population. Less than 4% of the population exceeded the health-based guidance value for PCDD/F+DL-PCBs. Mean exposure (95th percentile) to the six indicator PCBs (PCB 28, 52, 101, 138, 153, 180) was estimated at 2.71 (7.90)ng(kgbw)-1d-1 in the adult population and 3.77 (11.7)ng(kgbw)-1d-1 in the child and teenager population. Only 2.6% of the adults [CI95%: 1.9; 3.3] and 6.5% of the children and teenagers [5.2; 7.8] exceeded the health-based guidance value for total PCBs.These results show that the contamination levels in food and therefore the exposure of the general French population to PCDD/Fs and PCBs have declined (by a factor of 3.2 for PCDD/F. +. DL-PCBs and about three for total PCBs) since the last evaluation, which was conducted using another methodology in 2005 and 2007, and show the efficiency of the European risk management measures which came into force after these evaluations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background Phthalic acid esters are widely used in the manufacture of plastics. Numerous studies have shown that these phthalates impair testicular testosterone production in the rat. However, the scarce and contradictory data concerning humans have cast doubt over whether these compounds are also anti-androgenic in man. We therefore investigated the direct effects of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) on organo-cultured adult human testis and a human cell line. Methods Adult human testis explants or NCI-H295R adrenocortical human cells were cultured with DEHP or MEHP. The effects of ketoconazole, used as a reference molecule, were also assessed. Results In both models, DEHP and MEHP significantly inhibited testosterone production. The effects of both phthalates appeared to be specific for steroidogenesis, as INSL3 production by Leydig cells was not altered. Furthermore, the phthalates of interest had no effect on inhibin B production by Sertoli cells or on germ cell apoptosis. As only a small fraction of the phthalates added was found in the testis explants, and as these compounds were found to be metabolized, we estimate that the anti-androgenic effects observed occurred at concentrations of phthalates that are of the same order of magnitude as exposures reported in the literature for men. Conclusions We provide the first evidence that DEHP and MEHP can inhibit testosterone production in the adult human testis. This is consistent with recent epidemiological findings of an inverse correlation between exposure to MEHP and testosterone concentrations. © 2012 The Autho.},

abstract={Rationale: The control of forbidden anabolic practices in cattle in the European Union has become challenging since endogenous compounds such as estradiol derivatives can potentially be used as growth promoters. Due to the great difficulty in establishing a reference threshold value for endogenous steroids, the direct detection of steroid esters in hair is an efficient strategy for the detection of 'natural' steroid abuse in cattle. Methods: The present study aimed to develop and validate according to the current European standards a specific liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analytical strategy to monitor estrogen esters in bovine hair. The analysis was performed by positive ion electrospray ionisation (ESI+) after dansylation. Two acquisition modes were then assessed: single reaction monitoring and precursor ion scanning. Results: The results showed that the introduction of a dansylation step strongly improves the sensitivity of the detection of estradiol-17-esters by LC/(ESI+)-MS/MS. The CCα values are in the range 1-10 ng g-1 after optimisation, except for estradiol decanoate for which the derivatisation is not efficient. In addition, this LC/MS/MS approach makes it possible to carry out a precursor ion scan to screen for the presence of these estradiol 17-esters in hair samples. Conclusions: Based on the specific product ions, i.e. m/z 255 in native conditions or m/z 171 after dansylation, this strategy has the advantage of detecting any (un)known estradiol ester and of giving access to the [M + H]+ ion of the suspected ester through only a single analysis. © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The occurrence of endocrine disrupting chemicals such as estrogens in raw urban sewage is well documented. By contrast, the presence of other steroidal activities in wastewater has been poorly studied, although they can cause undesirable biological responses in the environment. In this work, extracts of raw wastewater were tested for agonist and antagonist activities on estrogen, androgen, progesterone, mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors. We detected strong estrogenic activities that correlated well with the concentration of natural estrogens (estrone, estriol and 17β-estradiol) measured by chemical analysis. We also measured strong androgenic activities which were not due to estrogen receptor ligands based on the use of recombinant estrogen receptor α affinity columns. Several molecules with androgenic activities were identified in wastewater samples, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and epiandrosterone being the most abundant. However, they explain only a small part of the detected androgenic activity, as indicated by the comparison of the detected biological responses with the results of the targeted chemical analysis. Finally, we found that our samples also contained strong antagonist activities on progesterone, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors. Very interestingly, we identified pregnenolone (the precursor to all steroid hormones in humans) as a major endocrine disrupting chemical which accounts for most of the anti-mineralocorticoid activities present in raw wastewater. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the occurrence of androgen agonists as well as other steroid receptor antagonists such as pregnenolone in raw wastewater. Further research is needed to assess the fate of such compounds during sewage treatment and their potential effect on living organisms. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are flame retardants widely used in electronic and domestic goods. These persistent pollutants are present in the environment and in humans, and their toxicological properties are of growing concern. PBDEs can be metabolised into compounds suspected to be responsible for their toxicity. These metabolites have been characterised quite well in rodents and fish, but available information in humans remains scarce. For their identification, an efficient method for the simultaneous analysis of PBDEs, hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs), and other PBDE metabolites in a single run was needed and has been developed in this work. Atmospheric pressure ionisation modes were compared, and Atmospheric Pressure Photo-Ionization (APPI) was selected. After careful setting of APPI parameters such as dopant and operating temperature, the optimised method was based on APPI ionization coupled to High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry operating in the full scan mode at a resolution of 60 000. This provided excellent sensitivity and specificity, allowing the discrimination of signals which could not be resolved on a triple quadrupole used as a reference. The full-scan high-resolution acquisition mode allowed monitoring of both parent PBDEs and their metabolites, including hydroxylated PBDEs, with detection limits ranging from 0.1 pg to 4.5 pg injected on-column based on the investigated standard compounds. The method was applied to the study of BDE-47 metabolism after incubation with human primary cultures of hepatocytes, and proved to be efficient not only for monitoring the parent compound and expected hydroxylated metabolites, but also for the identification of other non-targeted metabolites. In addition to hydroxy-BDE-47, several conjugated metabolites could be located, and the formation of a dihydrodiol derivative was evidenced for the first time in the case of PBDEs in this work.

abstract={Introduction: High concentrations of hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) sometimes recorded in free-range hens' eggs are thought to be due to soil ingestion. Of the three stereoisomers of HBCD (α-, β-, and γ-HBCD), γ-HBCD is the main component in the commercial mixture, as well as in environmental matrices, whereas the isomer profile is α-dominated in biota. In fish and in mammals, this shift is thought to be due to a rapid elimination of γ-HBCD and to its bioisomerization to the more persistent α-HBCD. The aim of the current controlled study was to better understand the fate of ingested HBCD in laying hens. The isomer profile in soil being γ-dominated, excretion kinetics of γ-HBCD into egg yolk, and accumulation in liver and in abdominal fat were investigated. Materials and methods: Forty-eight laying hens were individually housed and fed with a spiked diet containing 1. 1-ng γ-HBCD per gram for 21 days and with a clean diet for the following 18 days. Hens were sequentially slaughtered throughout the 39-day experiment. α-, β-, and γ-HBCD were analyzed in egg yolk, in abdominal fat, and in liver by LC-MS/MS. α- and γ-HBCD were quantified in the three tissues, while β-HBCD was never quantified. Results and conclusion: Kinetics of the two isomers suggests that γ-HBCD is rapidly biotransformed and eliminated, and partly isomerized into the more persistent α-HBCD. Carry-over rate of ingested γ-HBCD to egg yolk was estimated at 1. 2%. Estimated half-lives of γ-HBCD in egg yolk, in abdominal fat, and in liver were 2. 9, 13, and 0. 41 days, respectively. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The use of anabolic steroids as growth promoters for meat-producing animals is banned within the European Union. However, screening for the illegal use of natural steroid hormones still represents a difficult challenge because of the high interindividual and physiological variability of the endogenous concentration levels in animals. In this context, the development of untargeted profiling approaches for identifying new relevant biomarkers of exposure and/or effect has been emerging for a couple of years. The present study deals with an untargeted metabolomics approach on the basis of GC-MS aiming to reveal potential biomarkers signing a fraudulent administration of 4-androstenedione (AED), an anabolic androgenic steroid chosen as template. After a sample preparation based on microextraction by packed sorbent, urinary profiles of the free and deglucurono-conjugates urinary metabolites were acquired by GC-MS in the full-scan acquisition mode. Data processing and chemometric procedures highlighted 125 ions, allowing discrimination between samples collected before and after an administration of 4-AED. After a first evaluation of the signal robustness using additional and independent non-compliant samples, 17 steroid-like metabolites were pointed out as relevant candidate biomarkers. All these metabolites were then monitored using a targeted GC-MS/MS method for an additional assessment of their capacity to be used as biomarkers. Finally, two steroids, namely 5α-androstane-3β,17α-diol and 5α-androst-2-en-17-one, were concluded to be compatible with such a definition and which could be finally usable for screening purpose of AED abuse in cattle.

abstract={Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) are man-made chemicals for which endocrine disrupting properties and related possible side effects on human health have been reported, particularly in the case of an exposure during the early stages of development, (notably the perinatal period). Existing analytical methods dedicated to PFCs monitoring in food and/or human fluids are currently based on liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, and were recently demonstrated to present some limitations in terms of sensitivity and/or specificity. An alternative strategy dedicated to the analysis of fourteen PFCs in human breast milk was proposed, based on an effective sample preparation followed by a liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry measurement (LC-HRMS). This methodology confirmed the high interest for HRMS after negative ionization for such halogenated substances, and finally permitted to reach detection limits around the pgmL -1 range with an outstanding signal specificity compared to LC-MS/MS. The proposed method was applied to a first set of 30 breast milk samples from French women. The main PFCs detected in all these samples were PFOS and PFOA with respective median values of 74 (range from 24 to 171) and 57 (range from 18 to 102) pgmL -1, respectively. These exposure data appeared in the same range as other reported values for European countries. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) are usually monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on triple quadrupole instruments. Although not yet widely implemented in the field, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) today appears as a valuable alternative for these halogenated chemicals due to their significant mass defect. Indeed, this second approach offers a way to cope with particular matrix effects caused by co-eluting and isobaric interferences affecting the measurement of some PFCs in fish. The present study compares three different LC-MS-related instruments and various signal acquisition modes, from low-resolution full-scan and selected ion-monitoring (SIM) mode on a triple quadrupole (QqQ) instrument to high-resolution full-scan or product ion-scan mode on orbital trap (LTQ-Orbitrap) or quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) devices. Performances are compared for seven model compounds belonging to seven PFCs subclasses: perfluoralkylsulfonate, perfluoroalkylcarboxylate, perfluoroalkylsulfinate, perfluoroalkyl-sulfonamide, fluorotelomer saturated acid, fluorotelomer unsaturated acid and perfluoroalkylphosphonic acid. Low-resolution MS/MS was found to be unsurprisingly reliable for extended multi-residue monitoring. However, the high stability of PFCs leads to a relatively poor and non-specific fragmentation pathway in MS/MS. In addition, biliary acid-interfering compounds (e.g. taurochenodeoxycholic acid), which where encountered in the present case in fish samples but that may be present in other biological samples, were found particularly disturbing in low-resolution MS/MS. Indeed, these interferences presented the same retention time and diagnostic signals as PFOS, leading to a possible overestimation of the PFOS quantification in LC-MS/MS. On the other hand, high-resolution MS and MS/MS (LTQ-Orbitrap and Q-TOF) provided better results in terms of signal specificity and sensitivity. For instance, the estimated limits of detection (LOD) reached for PFOS on QqQ, Q-TOF and LTQ-Orbitrap instruments were 3.8, 0.7 and 0.5 pg injected, respectively. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={17β-Nandrolone (17β-NT) is one of the most frequently misused anabolic steroids in meat producing animals. As a result of its extensive metabolism combined with the possibility of interferences with other endogenous compounds, detection of its illegal use often turns out to be a difficult issue. In recent years, proving the illegal administration of 17β-NT became even more challenging since the presence of endogenous presence of 17β-NT or some of its metabolite in different species was demonstrated. In bovines, 17α-NT can occur naturally in the urine of pregnant cows and recent findings reported that both forms can be detected in injured animals. Because efficient control must both take into account metabolic patterns and associated kinetics of elimination, the purpose of the present study was to investigate further some estranediols (5α-estrane-3β,17β-diol (abb), 5β-estrane-3α,17β-diol (bab), 5α-estrane-3β, 17α-diol (aba), 5α-estrane-3α,17β-diol (aab) and 5β-estrane-3α,17α-diol (baa)) as particular metabolites of 17β-NT on a large number of injured (n = 65) or pregnant (n = 40) bovines. Whereas the metabolites abb, bab, aba and baa have previously been detected in urine up to several days after 17β-NT administration, the present study showed that some of the isomers abb (5α-estrane-3β,17β-diol) and bab (5β-estrane-3α,17β-diol) could not be detected in injured or pregnant animals, even at very low levels. This result may open a new way for the screening of anabolic steroid administration considering these 2 estranediols as biomarkers to indicate nandrolone abuse in cattle. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Dexamethasone, betamethasone, prednisolone and methylprednisolone are corticosteroids widely used in animal husbandry. These compounds are licensed for therapy in veterinary practices while their use for growth promoting practices, mainly in combination with other growth promoters, is prohibited within the European Union. In order to protect the consumer, maximum residue limits (MRLs) have been set by the European Community in liver to 2.0μgkg-1 (dexamethasone and betamethasone) and 10.0μgkg-1 (prednisolone and methylprednisolone) for different species. The major challenges in the analysis of dexamethasone and betamethasone consist in performing an efficient separation of both isomers and in detecting and identifying all the molecules according to the regulatory requirements fixed in Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. In this context, an UHPLC-MS/MS method with a short runtime (7min) and using the SRM acquisition mode was developed and validated. An efficient selectivity of the sample preparation combined with a high sensitivity of the measurement system allowed identifying and quantifying the four corticosteroids of interest in this complex biological matrix. Signals obtained were found very repeatable, even at very low concentration levels with an unambiguous identification of the compounds. The performance limits of the method have been validated according to the regulatory requirements and the method has been successfully applied to the confirmation of incurred liver samples. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The use of steroid hormones as growth promoters in cattle is banned within the European Union since 1988 but can still be fraudulently employed in animal breeding farms for anabolic purposes. While efficient targeted confirmatory methods have been implemented in control laboratories for many years, fast and reliable screening methods are still required, especially in the case of natural hormones abuse, but more globally for new "fishing" strategies allowing to reveal the use of even unknown anabolic agents. The development of focused profiling or untargeted metabolomic approaches is thus emerging in this context. The present study was a focused profiling study using steroids phase II metabolites, with the aim to get a better understanding of the steroid metabolism disruptions after exogenous administration of androstenedione and finally reveal potential biomarkers signing its administration. A sample preparation procedure was first developed, based on a separation of 31 glucuronide and sulphate conjugate compounds using an anion exchange SPE system. Each fraction was then analysed by UPLC-MS/MS in MRM mode showing a rapid (between 4. h and 4 days after treatment) and huge excretion of several direct metabolites of androstenedione such as etiocholanolone-glucuronide or epiandrosterone-sulphate. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Administration of hormonal compounds as growth promoters in livestock farming was banned by Council Directive 93/22/EC, however, this kind of substances are sometimes reported within the framework of European monitoring residue plans. Various analytical methods have been previously developed to screen for their misuse, and they are now especially efficient for monitoring the illegal administration of synthetic and semi-synthetic hormones. Nevertheless, proving an exogenous administration of hormones from natural origin (i.e. estradiol-17β or progesterone) still remains a challenging task for European authorities. As a result of their origin, these target compounds are indeed always present in the analytical matrix, and because the concentration levels of natural steroids are extremely variable from one animal to another, the establishment of reference thresholds appears very difficult. During this preliminary study, metabolomic data was acquired on a high performance liquid chromatography system coupled to high resolution mass spectrometer (HPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap). Serum samples were collected from dairy cows treated or not with sex steroid hormones commonly employed in animal husbandry: estradiol-17β (or its ester estradiol benzoate) and progesterone. After appropriate data processing and multivariate statistical analyses (OPLS-DA), it was possible to highlight significant metabolic modifications in serum consecutively to the administration of estradiol and/or progesterone. Those differences were used to build predictive models able to suspect illegal administration of these hormones in cattle. Potential biomarker candidates of estradiol and/or progesterone were pointed out, that remains to be structurally elucidated. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The recombinant bovine growth hormone (rbST) is used to increase lactating performances of dairy cows. Administration of rbST is banned in the European Union; nevertheless, its use is probable. Until now, efficient analytical strategies to detect such practice are based on the direct detection by mass spectrometry of the presence of rbST in biological fluids, which suits for confirmatory purposes. Current screening strategies do not offer satisfactory performances; therefore, alternative screening strategies are required. The aim of the present work is to develop and validate an ELISA to measure the production of specific antibodies upon rbST in bovine sera. In this immunoassay, rbST is absorbed onto microtiter plate. After specific purification of the antibodies in serum, samples are analysed and the presence of antibodies anti-rbST is detected by Protein G peroxidase conjugate and 2-2′-azino di-ethyl benz-thiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS). The mean reproducibility of the OD (λ= 405. nm) measurement was calculated with a CV of 13%. The intra- and inter-assay CVs ranged from 0.79% to 7.91% and from 2.69% to 20% respectively. The test presents cross-reaction with other growth hormones such as the recombinant equine (reST) and porcine (pST) (100% and 80% respectively). The specificity of the test toward rbST anabolic treatment was confirmed through the analysis of sera samples collected on animals administered with other anabolic compounds (steroids).The performances of the present anti-rbST ELISA proves its efficiency as a new screening tool to highlight illegal administration of rbST in cattle up to at least 3 weeks after treatment. © 2011.},

abstract={Anabolic steroids are banned in food producing livestock in Europe. Efficient methods based on mass spectrometry detection have been developed to ensure the control of such veterinary drug residues. Nevertheless, the use of "cocktails" composed of mixtures of low amounts of several substances as well as the synthesis of new compounds of unknown structure prevent efficient prevention. New analytical tools able to detect such abuse are today mandatory. In this context, metabolomics may represent new emerging strategies for investigating the global physiological effects associated to a family of substances and therefore, to suspect the administration of steroids. The purpose of the present study was to set up, assess and compare two complementary mass spectrometry-based metabolomic strategies as new tools to screen for steroid abuse in cattle and demonstrate the feasibility of such approaches. The protocols were developed in two European laboratories in charge of residues analysis in the field of food safety. Apart from sample preparation, the global process was different in both laboratories from LC-HRMS fingerprinting to multivariate data analysis through data processing and involved both LC-Orbitrap-XCMS and UPLC-ToF-MS-MetAlign strategies. The reproducibility of both sample preparation and MS measurements were assessed in order to guarantee that any differences in the acquired fingerprints were not caused by analytical variability but reflect metabolome modifications upon steroids administration. The protocols were then applied to urine samples collected on a large group of animals consisting of 12 control calves and 12 calves administrated with a mixture of 17β-estradiol 3-benzoate and 17β-nandrolone laureate esters according to a protocol reflecting likely illegal practices. The modifications in urine profiles as indicators of steroid administration have been evaluated in this context and proved the suitability of the approach for discriminating anabolic treated animals from control ones. Such an approach may therefore open a new way for the screening of anabolic steroid administration through targeted monitoring of relevant biomarkers highlighted as a result of the metabolomics study. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Therefore, the need to ensure the quality and safety of sport supplements for the consumer is essential. The development and validation of two reporter gene assays coupled with solid phase sample preparation enabling the detection of estrogenic and androgenic constituents in sport supplements is reported. Both assays were shown to be of high sensitivity with the estrogen and androgen reporter gene assays having an EC50 of 0.01ngmL-1 and 0.16ngmL-1 respectively. The developed assays were applied in a survey of 63 sport supplements samples obtained across the Island of Ireland with an additional seven reference samples previously investigated using LC-MS/MS. Androgen and estrogen bio-activity was found in 71% of the investigated samples. Bio-activity profiling was further broken down into agonists, partial agonists and antagonists. Supplements (13) with the strongest estrogenic bio-activity were chosen for further investigation. LC-MS/MS analysis of these samples determined the presence of phytoestrogens in seven of them. Supplements (38) with androgen bio-activity were also selected for further investigation. Androgen agonist bio-activity was detected in 12 supplements, antagonistic bio-activity was detected in 16 and partial antagonistic bio-activity was detected in 10. A further group of supplements (7) did not present androgenic bio-activity when tested alone but enhanced the androgenic agonist bio-activity of dihydrotestosterone when combined. The developed assays offer advantages in detection of known, unknown and low-level mixtures of endocrine disruptors over existing analytical screening techniques. For the detection and identification of constituent hormonally active compounds the combination of biological and physio-chemical techniques is optimal. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Thyreostats are growth-promoters banned in Europe since 1981. The identification of thiouracil (TU) in animal biological matrices can, however, no longer be systematically interpreted as a consequence of illegal administration. Indeed, some experimental results have indicated a causal link between cruciferous-based diet and the presence of TU in urine of bovines. The present study aims at investigating, on a large scale (n &gt; 1300), the natural occurrence of thiouracil in urine samples collected from different animal species. TU was identified in main breeding animal species: bovine, porcine and ovine. The natural distribution of TU allowed proposing threshold values to differentiate compliant from suspect urine samples. Suggested values are 5.7 and 9.1 μg l -1 in male adult bovines (6-24 months), 3.1 and 8.1 μg l -1 in female adult bovines (6-24 months), 7.3 and 17.7 μg l -1 in calves (&lt;6 months), 3.9 and 8.8 μg l -1 in female bovines (&gt;24 months), and 2.9 and 4.1 μg l -1 in porcines at a 95 and 99% confidence level, respectively. © 2011 Taylor &amp; Francis.},

abstract={Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), along with postnatal growth trajectory, is closely linked with metabolic diseases and obesity at adulthood. The present study reports the time-dependent metabolomic response of male offspring of rat dams exposed to maternal adequate protein diet during pregnancy and lactation (CC) or protein deprivation during pregnancy only (IUGR with rapid catch-up growth, RC) or through pregnancy and lactation (IUGR with slow postnatal growth, RR). Plasma LC-HRMS metabolomic fingerprints for 8 male rats per group, combined with multivariate statistical analysis (PLS-DA and HCA), were used to study the impact of IUGR and postnatal growth velocity on the offspring metabolism in early life (until weaning) and once they reached adulthood (8 months). Compared with CC rats, RR pups had clear-cut alterations in plasma metabolome during suckling, but none at adulthood; in contrast, in RC pups, alterations in metabolome were minimal in early life but more pronounced in the long run. In particular, our results pinpoint transient alterations in proline, arginine, and histidine in RR rats, compared to CC rats, and persistent differences in tyrosine and carnitine, compared to RC rats at adulthood. These findings suggest that the long-term deregulation in feeding behavior and fatty acid metabolism in IUGR rats depends on postnatal growth velocity. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The detection and structural elucidation of micropollutants treatment by-products are major issues to estimate efficiencies of the processes employed for drinking water production versus endocrine disruptive compounds contamination. This issue was mainly investigated at the laboratory scale and in high concentration conditions. However, potential by-products generated after chlorination can be influenced by the dilution factor employed in real conditions. The present study proposes a new methodology borrowed to the metabolomic science, using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry, in order to reveal potential chlorination by-products of ethinylestradiol in spiked real water samples at the part-per-billion level (5μgL-1). Conventional targeted measurements first demonstrated that chlorination with sodium hypochlorite (0.8mgL-1) led to removals of ethinylestradiol over 97%. Then, the developed differential global profiling approach permitted to reveal eight chlorination by-products of EE2, six of them being described for the first time. Among these eight halogenated compounds, five have been structurally identified, demonstrating the potential capabilities of this new methodology applied to environmental samples. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In recent years, questions have been raised on the possible semi-endogenous status of the alleged xenobiotic thyreostatic drug thiouracil; thiouracil has been detected in the urine of various animals (livestock and domesticated) at concentrations between 1 and 10 μg L-1 and also in human urine. Although several studies suggest Brassicaceae-derived feed as potential origin, no traces of thiouracil have been detected in feed so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to elucidate the origin of thiouracil in the urine of livestock and humans. To this purpose various Brassicaceae feed and food sources (e.g., rapeseed, rapeseed coarse meal, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli) were investigated for the presence of thiouracil. In addition, the impact of the Brassicaceae-related β-thioglucosidase enzyme was evaluated. This myrosinase enzyme appeared to be crucial, because without its catalyzed hydrolysis no thiouracil could be detected in the various Brassicaceae-derived samples. Therefore, a sample pretreatment with incorporated enzymatic hydrolysis was developed after ensuring the quality performance of the extracted myrosinase mixture with a single-point glucose assay. Upon enzymatic hydrolysis and LC-MS2 analysis, thiouracil was successfully detected in samples of traditional rapeseed, rapeseed-'00' variety coarse meal (values of erucic acid &lt;2% and glucosinolates &lt;25 μmol g-1), and rapeseed cake at 1.5,1.6, and 0.4 μg kg-1, respectively. As for the food samples, broccoli and cauliflower displayed thiouracil concentrations of 6.0 and &lt;1.0 μg kg-1, respectively. To the best of the authors' knowledge this study is the first to report the presence of naturally occurring thiouracil in feed and food samples. Future research should investigate the pathway of thiouracil formation and identify its possible precursors. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

The results demonstrated that the values of the total PCDD/Fs (∑PCDD/Fs) concentrations were considerably lower than those of the sum of dl-PCBs (∑dl-PCBs) in all the studied samples. Regarding the contribution of individual congeners, OCDD was the predominant PCDD/F and the mono-ortho PCB 118 and PCB 105 were the dominant PCBs in the majority of the samples. Our results suggest that PCDD/Fs and PCBs behave quite differently along the aquatic food web: ∑PCDD/Fs concentrations were lower in higher trophic-level organisms with fish presenting a distinct PCDD/Fs congeners profile; on the contrary, the higher ∑dl-PCBs values were found in upper-level biota, although not exclusively, and quite similar dl-PCBs congener profiles were observed in nearly all the studied species. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background: In humans, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are stored primarily in adipose tissue. Their total body burden and their contribution to obesity-associated diseases remain unclear. Objectives: We characterized POP total body burden and their redistribution in obese individuals before and after drastic weight loss and compared these values with a variety of molecular, biological, and clinical parameters. Methods: Seventy-one obese subjects were enrolled and underwent bariatric surgery. Blood and adipose tissue samples were obtained at different times from these individuals as well as from 18 lean women. Results: POP content (17 dioxins/furans and 18 polychlorinated biphenyl congeners) in different adipose tissue territories was similar, allowing us to assess total POP body burden from a single biopsy. Total POP body burden was 2 to 3 times higher in obese than in lean individuals. We also found increased expression of some POP target genes in obese adipose tissue. Drastic weight loss led to increased serum POPs and, within 6-12 months, to a significant 15% decrease in total polychlorinated biphenyl body burden. Importantly, serum POP levels were positively correlated with liver toxicity markers and lipid parameters, independently of age and body mass index. Conclusions: POP content in adipose tissue and serum correlate with biological markers of obesity-related dysfunctions. Drastic weight loss leads to a redistribution of POPs and to a moderate decrease of their total body burden.},

abstract={Mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics is emerging as an important field of research in many scientific areas, including chemical safety of food. A particular strength of this approach is its potential to reveal some physiological effects induced by complex mixtures of chemicals present at trace concentrations. The limitations of other analytical approaches currently employed to detect low-dose and mixture effects of chemicals make detection very problematic. Besides this basic technical challenge, numerous analytical choices have to be made at each step of a metabolomics study, and each step can have a direct impact on the final results obtained and their interpretation (i.e. sample preparation, sample introduction, ionization, signal acquisition, data processing, and data analysis). As the application of metabolomics to chemical analysis of food is still in its infancy, no consensus has yet been reached on defining many of these important parameters. In this context, the aim of the present study is to review all these aspects of MS-based approaches to metabolomics, and to give a comprehensive, critical overview of the current state of the art, possible pitfalls, and future challenges and trends linked to this emerging field. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Unprecedented biotechnological advances in the past decade have delivered powerful transcriptomics methods that provide new opportunities for a risk-based and, hence, more effective control of food quality and safety. The fundamental hypothesis underlying the application of a transcriptomics or other "-omics" strategies is that toxicant-specific changes of gene expression will reveal the presence of chemical hazards with possibly adverse health effects. Indeed, living cells display wide adaptive plasticity by responding with characteristic expression signatures to various stimuli (e.g., proliferation signals, genotoxic or cytotoxic insults, oxidative bursts and other types of chemical stress). Flexible transcriptomics platforms that can be scaled to suit different applications in food quality and safety involve oligonucleotide microarrays (also known as "DNA chips"), focused polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays and, more recently, high-throughput "next generation" sequencing technologies. In this review, we illustrate the potential impact of transcriptomics for the detection of hazardous food constituents or contaminants, including dioxins, xenoestrogens, mycotoxins and Maillard reaction products.

abstract={Growth hormones are proteins produced by the anterior pituitary gland responsible for bone and tissue growth through their effects on carbohydrates, lipids and proteins metabolisms. Despite strict regulations banning the use of recombinant equine growth hormone, this substance is suspected to be misused to improve the horse physical performances. In order to check whether the regulation is fulfilled or not, controls are organized and a new analytical screening tool potentially able to detect such abuse was investigated in this paper. An untargeted metabolomics approach, based on liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry, was developed and applied to characterize and compare horse urinary and plasmatic metabolic profiles upon reGH administrations. After minimal sample preparation, biological fluids were analyzed by LC-ESI(±)-Q-TOF. Data processing was performed by XCMS software and multivariate data analysis applied to the generated data set allowed building OPLS models to discriminate control versus treated populations. Results demonstrated significant metabolic modifications consecutively to the reGH treatment. A comparative study between urinary and plasmatic signatures was performed to evaluate the resulting metabolomic models and to asses their respective interests in the scope of real application for screening reGH administration. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Corticosteroids are hormonal substances widely used in human and veterinary medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. Among the numerous existing artificial corticosteroids, dexamethasone remains the most commonly used, mainly throughout esterified forms such as acetate or phosphate. An experimental study was designed to assess its drug residue levels in urine and feces, as well as its fixation in bovine hair following a single administration of 0.15 mg/kg b.w. dexamethasone acetate and 0.12 mg/kg b.w. dexamethasone sodium phosphate. Different analytical methods based on GC-MS or LC-MS/MS were used for measuring dexamethasone and its esterified forms, which were implemented in 3 different European laboratories in the field that collaborated for this study. The obtained results confirmed the high and rapid urinary excretion rate of dexamethasone, with a maximal concentration (267 μg/L) measured one day after administration and 98% elimination within 3 days. The concentrations obtained with the GC-NCI-MS procedure (using chemical oxidation as derivatization) were found significantly higher than the ones obtained with LC-ESI-MS/MS, indicating a possible contribution of dexamethasone phase I and/or II metabolites to the monitored signal. Fecal elimination was also found rapid (95% elimination within 3 days) with a maximum concentration level (28.5 μg/kg) observed one day after administration. Detectable levels of dexamethasone in hair appeared on day 2 (11.5 μg/kg), reached a maximum around one week, and could be identified until 22 days upon treatment, establishing the suitability of hair as a biological matrix for medium to long-term residue controls of dexamethasone. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={This review deals with the potential of profiling approaches as valuable tools for combating the illegal use of growth promoters in cattle breeding. Detection of illegal practices classically relies on residue monitoring in a targeted approach and methods based on gas or liquid chromatography coupled to (tandem) mass spectrometry are considered state of the art. However, these strategies fail when faced with new xenobiotic growth-promoting agents or new ways of application, such as administration of low-dose cocktails. In this context, screening strategies allowing detection of the physiological response resulting from administration of anabolic compounds are promising approaches to detect misuse. Profiling biological matrices to reveal biological effects of a drug can be performed by targeting a particular class of compounds or in an untargeted way using global strategies, such as transcriptomics, proteomics or metabolomics. These emerging tactics are promising ways to highlight candidate biomarkers to tackle illegal practices. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The use of steroid hormones as growth promoters in cattle has been banned within the European Union since 1988 but can still be fraudulently employed in animal breeding farms for anabolic purposes. If an efficient monitoring of synthetic compounds (screening and confirmation) is ensured today by many laboratories, pointing out suspicious samples from a natural steroids abuse remains a tricky challenge due to the difficulty to set relevant threshold levels for these endogenous compounds. The development of focused profiling or untargeted metabolomic approaches is then emerging in this context, with the objective to reveal potential biomarkers signing an exogenous administration of such natural steroids. This study aimed to assess sample preparation procedures based on microextraction and adapt them to high throughput urinary profiling or metabolomic analyses based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry measurement. Two techniques have been tested and optimised, namely solid phase microextraction (SPME) and microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS), using five model steroid metabolites (16α-hydroxyandrosterone, 2α-hydroxytestosterone, 11-keto,5β-androstanedione, 6α-hydroxyestradiol and 7β-hydroxypregnenolone). The considered performance criteria included not only the absolute response of the targeted compounds but also the robustness of the materials, and the global aspect of the diagnostic ion chromatograms obtained. After only five successive urinary extractions, a clear degradation of the SPME fiber was observed which led to discard this method as a relevant technique for profiling, whereas no degradation was observed on MEPS sorbent. Repeatability and recovery yields were calculated from urine samples fortified at 500μgL-1 and extracted by MEPS. They were found respectively below 11% and above 60% for all model compounds. Detection limits were in the 5-15μgL-1 range depending on the compounds, and a good linearity was observed on the 10-75μgL-1 range (R2&gt;0.99). This methodology was applied on urine samples collected from control versus androstenedione-treated bovines, revealing a significant concentration increase for several well-known metabolites such as etiocholanolone, 5α-androstane-3β,17α-diol, 5β-androstane-3α,17α-diol and 5-androstene-3β,17α-diol. Finally, these results allowed to confirm the suitability of the developed strategy and give to this new MEPS application a promising interest in the field of GC-MS based steroid profiling and metabolomic. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={17β-Nandrolone (17β-NT) is one of the most recurrent forbidden anabolic steroid used in meat producing animals breeding. Because efficient control must both take into account metabolic patterns and associated kinetics of elimination, the metabolism of 17β-NT in bovines has already been investigated and is well documented, but only focussing on its main metabolites (i.e. 17α-nandrolone, 19-noretiocholanolone and 19-norandrostenedione). The goal of the present study was to enlarge this panel of 17β-NT metabolites, especially through the urinary estranediols fraction in order to perform a more global steroid profiling upon 17β-nortestosterone laureate ester administration in calves. A GC-MS/MS method has been developed to monitor and quantify 5 estranediols isomers including 5α-estrane-3β,17β-diol (abb), 5β-estrane-3α,17β-diol (bab), 5α-estrane-3β,17α-diol (aba), 5α-estrane-3α,17β-diol (aab) and 5β-estrane-3α,17α-diol (baa). Their urinary elimination kinetics have been established allowing detection of 4 estranediols up to several days after administration. All animals demonstrated homogeneous patterns of elimination both from a qualitative (metabolite profile) and quantitative point of view (elimination kinetics in urine). 5α-Estrane-3β,17α-diol (aba) was found as the major metabolite with concentrations up to 100μgL-1. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={A LC-MS/MS method has been developed for the direct detection of recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) in milk and dairy products. The sample preparation protocol is based on a solid phase extraction step followed by precipitation with cold methanol and enzymatic digestion. The analysis is focused on the tryptic N-terminal peptide, specific of the recombinant form of the hormone and the detection is performed by LC-ESI(+)-MS/MS. This method has been validated according to the European Union criteria described in the Directive 2002/657/EC. Acceptable performances, with a decision limit (CCα) of 1.24ngmL-1 and detection capability (CCβ) of 1.92ngmL-1 were obtained. Calculation of repeatability and intermediate reproducibility of the signal at 100ngmL-1 lead to relative standard deviations lower than 20%, showing the robustness of the method. Samples subjected to various industrial processes namely, heating, freezing, defatting, pasteurization and spray-drying were then analysed in order to determine the consequences of these treatments on the stability of the hormone. Results showed that temperature related processes, such as pasteurization and spray-drying induce a loss of the hormone up to 95%. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This study investigated milk excretion kinetics of PCBs, tetraBDE (BDE 47), and penta-BDE (BDE 99) in goats exposed to contaminated soil under controlled conditions. The animals were fed (80 days) with feed containing 5% of contaminated soil. During this exposure period, milk was analyzed weekly. At the end of the experiment the PCBs and PBDEs retained in hepatic and adipose tissues were also determined. The soilmilk carry over rates (CORs) of PCBs ranged from 6 to 62%. This result suggests that a large part of ingested soil-bound PCBs was recovered in milk. Significantly different levels between the congeners were reported in the tissues (fat, liver). BDE 47 and 99 excretions in milk achieved a plateau after 2 weeks of exposure, and their corresponding CORs were about 30%. These two congeners showed a significantly (P < 0.05) lower accumulation in the adipose tissue than the major PCB congeners. The concentrations of BDE 47 and 99 in the liver were the same as PCB concentrations. This result suggests that the low brominated congeners are submitted to the metabolism more extensively than the major PCBs. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins, polychorodibenzofurans and "dioxin-like" polychlorinated biphenyls are widespread persistent organic pollutants sharing a similar toxicological pathway mediated by the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Since the confirmatory method for their measurement at trace levels in complex matrices (using isotopic dilution and gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry) remains time and cost-consuming, growing efforts of the scientific community have been focused on the development of screening approaches, including AhR mediated assays. Unfortunately, AhR ligands are highly diverse and agonistic/antagonistic effects can be observed on procedural blanks and/or sample extracts. In this study, the influence of solvent grade quality on the response of a DNA-binding AhR mediated assay used for screening dioxins has been investigated. Our results demonstrated a very critical impact of this parameter with both strong agonistic and antagonistic effects observed for any tested solvent lot. A small silver nitrate silica column removed partly these interfering compounds and then can be recommended as final purification step. Some preferable grades can be identified and selected in order to guarantee the best possible performances. However, it appears necessary to test every new lot, even if a grade appeared previously compliant. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We have investigated the composition of the mobile natural organic matter (NOM) present in Callovo-Oxfodian pore water using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), atmos-pheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (APCI-MS) and emission-excitation matrix (EEM) spectroscopy. The generation of knowledge of the composition, structure and size of mobile NOM is necessary if one wants to understand the interactions of these compounds with heavy metals/ radionuclides, in the context of environmental studies, and particularly how the mobility of these trace elements is affected by mobile NOM. The proposed methodology is very sensitive in unambiguously identifying the in situ composition of dissolved NOM in water even at very low NOM concentration, due to innovative non-disturbing water sampling and ionization (ESI/APCI-MS) techniques. It was possible to analyze a quite exhaustive inventory of the small organic compounds of clay pore water without proceeding to any chemical treatment at naturally occurring concentration levels. The structural features observed were mainly acidic compounds and fatty acids as well as aldehydes and amino acids. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The recombinant equine somatotropin (reST) is used as internal standard. Performance of the method was assessed based on specificity, linearity, trueness and repeatability. Decision limit (CCα) and detection capability (CQβ) were found to be 2.5 ng mL-1 and 6.8 ng mL-1, respectively. This method was subsequently applied to the analysis of serum and plasma collected from two different animals treated with 500 mg of rbST. No significant variations were observed when analyzing either serum or plasma, but an important difference between animals was encountered.

abstract={To ensure delivery of safe animal products to consumers, the withdrawal time (WDT) of drugs must be respected. Property differences among pharmaceutical formulations, for the same drugs, can lead to differences in the WDTs estimation. The WDTs of four commercial formulations of enrofloxacin (ENRO) in broiler chickens, considering MRLs established by different countries, were studied. Two hundred-thirty-four broiler chicks were allotted among four groups; the formulations were orally administered daily with 10 mg/kg bw. After treatment, six chickens of each group and two controls were slaughtered daily until day 9 post-treatment. Samples of muscle and liver were collected, and analyzed using HPLC-MS-MS. The WDTs among formulations of ENRO showed differences of 24 and 48 h. Based on the European Community and Chile MRLs of 100 μg/kg (muscle) and 200 μg/kg (liver), the WDTs did not exceed 5 days. When Japan MRL was considered (10 μg/kg<inf>,</inf>), the WDTs increased up to 8 days. These results indicate that for WDTs determination, the differences among pharmaceutical formulations of a drug must be considered as well as the MRLs. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Context: Estrogens and androgens play key roles for pubertal onset and sexual maturation. Most currently used immunoassays are not sensitive enough to accurately measure the low circulating levels of sex steroids in children without any signs of puberty. However, this does not exclude that sex steroids have important biological roles in prepubertal children. Objectives: To accurately determine levels of sex steroid hormones and their metabolites in serum of healthy children before any physical signs of puberty and to evaluate possible sex differences. Main Outcome Measures: Total (unconjugated plus conjugated) serum levels of 17β-testosterone, 17α-testosterone, 5α-dihydrotestosterone, 5β-dihydrotestosterone, androsterone, etiocholanolone, estradiol, and estrone measured by an ultrasensitive method based on gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in samples from 81 healthy schoolchildren (42 boys) without any signs of puberty. For comparison, 48 pubertal children were studied. Results: 17β-Estradiol levels in prepubertal boys were undetectable or extremely low (median < 3.7 pmol/liter), whereas levels in prepubertal girls were significantly higher (median 9.6 pmol/liter, P < 0.001). Among the older prepubertal children (>8 yr), girls had significantly higher androsterone (4.07 vs. 1.45 nmol/liter, P < 0.05), etiocholanolone (5.45 vs. 1.95 nmol/liter, P < 0.0001), 5α-dihydrotestosterone (0.11 vs. <0.10 nmol/liter, P < 0.01), and 17β-testosterone concentrations (0.69 vs. 0.47 nmol/liter, P < 0.05) compared with similarly aged prepubertal boys. Conclusion: Using an accurate and sensitive method, we found significantly higher levels of estrogens as well asandrogenmetabolites in prepubertal girlscomparedwith age-matched boys.The higher prepubertal sex steroid levels in girls may contribute to their earlier onset of puberty including pubic hair development.

abstract={Penicillium expansum is a ubiquitous species for which there are only few reports for chemical investigation in marine environments. Among the numerous secondary metabolites produced by this species, communesins represent a new class of cytotoxic and insecticidal indole alkaloids. In this study, we investigated a marine P. expansum strain exhibiting neuroactivity on a Diptera larvae bioassay. Bio-guided purification led to the isolation and the identification of communesin B as the main active compound by HRMS and 1H and 13C NMR. Liquid chromatography analyses with detection by electrospray ionization coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) and high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC/HRMS/MS) allowed the identification and characterization of four other known communesins (A, D, E and F) in the crude extract. A fragmentation model for dimethyl epoxide communesins was proposed after detailed interpretation of their MS/MS spectra. Further analyses of the extract using the modelled fragmentations led to the detection of seven new communesins found as minor compounds. Chemical structural elucidation of these new derivatives is discussed based on their fragmentation characteristics. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The presence and metabolism of endogenous steroid hormones in meat-producing animals has been the subject of much research over the past 40 years. While significant data are available, no comprehensive review has yet been performed. Species considered in this review are bovine, porcine, ovine, equine, caprine and cervine, while steroid hormones include the androgenic-anabolic steroids testosterone, nandrolone and boldenone, as well as their precursors and metabolites. Information on endogenous steroid hormone concentrations is primarily useful in two ways: (1) in relation to pathological versus 'normal' physiology and (2) in relation to the detection of the illegal abuse of these hormones in residue surveillance programmes. Since the major focus of this review is on the detection of steroids abuse in animal production, the information gathered to date is used to guide future research. A major deficiency in much of the existing published literature is the lack of standardization and formal validation of experimental approach. Key articles are cited that highlight the huge variation in reported steroid concentrations that can result when samples are analysed by different laboratories under different conditions. These deficiencies are in most cases so fundamental that it is difficult to make reliable comparisons between data sets and hence it is currently impossible to recommend definitive detection strategies. Standardization of the experimental approach would need to involve common experimental protocols and collaboratively validated analytical methods. In particular, standardization would need to cover everything from the demographic of the animal population studied, the method of sample collection and storage (especially the need to sample live versus slaughter sampling since the two methods of surveillance have very different requirements, particularly temporally), sample preparation technique (including mode of extraction, hydrolysis and derivatization), the end-point analytical detection technique, validation protocols, and the statistical methods applied to the resulting data. Although efforts are already underway (at HFL and LABERCA) to produce more definitive data and promote communication among the scientific community on this issue, the convening of a formal European Union working party is recommended. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Among the numerous PCB congeners, most of the dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs) need to be characterized by hyphenated techniques. It has been shown in several instances that these congeners are well related to the total PCB content in fish. We examined datasets collected mainly in France, on freshwater and marine fish and sediments. A statistical model linking DL- and indicator PCBs was developed for a dataset composed of freshwater fishes, and proved to predict well DL-PCBs from indicator PCBs in all other fish sets, including marine ones. Type II error rates remained low in almost all fish sets. A similar correlation was observed in sediments. Non-dioxin-like PCBs elicit various adverse effects and represent 95% of the total PCBs. A European guideline for them is needed; the correlation between DL- and indicator PCBs could help develop this standard in the future. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Several classes of chemical compounds, exhibiting many different chemical properties, are classified under the generic term of "veterinary drugs", among which are the antimicrobial medicines such as antibiotics or dyes, and drugs exhibiting growth promoting properties like steroids, β-agonist compounds, thyrostats or growth hormones. For food safety purposes, the resort to these substances in animal breeding has been submitted to strict regulation within the European Union for more than 15 years. Systems of control have therefore been set up within the same period of time to ensure compliance with the regulation. The current strategy relies on targeted analytical approaches focusing on the detection of residues of the administered compounds or their metabolites in different kinds of feed, food or biological matrices. If screening methods, which provide rapid discrimination between compliant and suspect samples, may be based on several techniques such as immunoassays or mass spectrometry, confirmatory methods mainly rely on the latter, which provides adequate specificity and sensitivity for unambiguous identification of the target analytes in biological matrices at trace level. The present article reviews the main mass spectrometric strategies, from the very first, nonetheless still efficient, single MS and multidimensional and high-resolution MS through to advanced isotope ratio MS. Several applications in the field of residue analysis illustrate each of these approaches and focus on the balance between issues related to the compounds of interest (chemistry, matrix, concentration, ...) and the large offer of mass spectrometric-related technical possibilities, from the choice of the ionization conditions (EI, NCI, PCI, reagent gases, ESI+, ESI-), to the mass analyzers (single quadrupole, triple quadrupole, ion traps, time-of-flight, magnetic sectors, isotope ratio mass spectrometer) and corresponding acquisition modes (full scan, LR-SIM, HR-SIM, SRM, precursor scan, ...). All the displayed strategies, from the importance of sample preparation to MS analysis to potential derivatization steps and chromatographic separation parameters are discussed in that context. Besides the advantages of each strategy, main issues associated to such MS approaches are commented with an emphasis not only on such critical points as ion suppression and resolution, but also on the adequacy of the current regulation regarding the evolution of the technology. Finally, future trends which may lead to strong and positive impacts in the field of residue analysis are presented, including latest developments and improvements in chromatography or software dedicated to signal acquisition and data analysis. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Boldenone is banned in the European Union (Directive 96/22/EC) as growth promoter for meat producing animals. Boldione (ADD), boldenone and boldenone esters (mainly the undecylenate form) are commercially available as anabolic preparations, either to the destination of human, horse or cattle. Since the late 90s, the natural occurrence of boldenone metabolites has been reported in cattle. According to EU regulation, the unambiguous demonstration of boldenone administration in bovine urine should be provided on the basis of boldenone identification in the corresponding conjugate fraction. An analytical method has been developed and validated according to current standards with main concern to the measurement of intact 17β-boldenone-sulphate. The analytical procedure included direct extraction-purification of target analyte on octadecylsilyl cartridges and direct detection of phase II metabolite by liquid chromatography (negative electrospray), tandem mass spectrometry (QqQ) or high resolution mass spectrometry (Orbitrap™). Decision limit (CCα) and detection capability (CCβ) were respectively 0.2 μg L-1 and 0.4 μg L-1 on triple quadrupole and 0.1 μg L-1 and 0.2 μg L-1 on hybrid system. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of incurred samples collected in different experiments. 17β-Boldenone-sulphate was measurable up to 36 h after oral administration of boldione, and 30 days after 17β-boldenone undecylenate intra-muscular injection. This conjugate form was never detected in non-treated animals, confirming its status of definitive candidate marker for boldenone administration in calf. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={β-agonist compounds can be misused in food-producing animals for growth promoting purposes. Efficient methods based on mass spectrometry detection have been developed to ensure the control of such veterinary drug residues. Nevertheless, the use of "cocktails" composed of mixtures of low amounts of several substances as well as the synthesis of new compounds of unknown structure prevent efficient prevention. To circumvent those problems, new analytical tools able to detect such abuse are today mandatory. In this context, metabolomics may represent a new emerging strategy for investigating the global physiological effects associated to a family of substances and therefore, to suspect the administration of β-agonists (either "cocktails" or unknown compounds). As a first demonstration of feasibility, an untargeted metabolomic approach based on liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry measurements was developed and made it possible to highlight metabolic modifications in urine consecutively to a clenbuterol administration. By the means of chemometrics, those metabolic differences were used to build predictive models able to suspect clenbuterol administration in calves. This new approach may be considered of valuable interest to overcome current limitations in the control of growth promoters' abuse, with promising perspectives in terms of screening. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Despite the worldwide existing regulation banning the use of the recombinant equine growth hormone (reGH) as growth promoter, it is suspected to be used in horseracing to improve performances. Various analytical methods previously developed to screen for its misuse have encountered some limitations in terms of detection timeframes, in particular during the first days following reGH administration. A novel strategy involving the characterization of global metabolomic fingerprints in urine samples of non-treated and reGH-treated horses by liquid chromatography-electrospray-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-HRMS) is described and assessed in this paper in order to develop a new screening tool for growth hormone abuse in horseracing. The strategy involves a limited sample preparation of the urine samples and the use of appropriate software for data processing and analysis. As preliminary work, reproducibility of both sample preparation and mass spectrometry (MS) measurements was evaluated in order to demonstrate the reliability of the method. Application of the developed protocol on two horses demonstrated the suitability of the developed strategy and preliminary results showed significant modifications of the metabolome after treatment with reGH.

abstract={NDL-PCBs dietary intake was recently estimated in France by combining results of food products contamination by NDL-PCBs (1665 samples collected through 2002-2006 national monitoring programs) with food consumption data of the French "INCA" survey (individual and national survey of dietary intake, performed in 1998-1999). The mean dietary intake of NDL-PCBs estimated from the sum of 6 congeners (PCB 28, 52, 101, 138, 153, 180) is 7.6, 7.7 and 12.9 ng/kg bw/d for women of childbearing age (19-44 years), adults (15 years and over) and children (3-14 years), respectively. Impact of draft maximal levels (MLs) for NDL-PCBs in some foodstuffs was evaluated. The exposure scenario indicates that use of European draft MLs would have a very limited impact on the French population dietary exposure compared with the existing situation (no MLs). Simulations show that lowered MLs required for reducing significantly the French exposure would result to reject more than 20% of the targeted products from the French market compared with 1.3% according to the European draft MLs. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={This experiment was aimed at determining the bioavailability of three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in goats: phenanthrene, pyrene, and benzo[a]pyrene. A Latin square design procedure was carried out involving three alpine lactating goats and three PAH-contaminated matrices (soil, hay, and oil as a control). Milk and urine samples were collected to assess PAH and hydroxy-PAH excretion kinetics and to compare the carry-over rates for the different matrices. PAHs were found to be excreted mainly in urine; metabolite concentrations were about 20 times higher in urine than in milk. 1-Hydroxypyrene was the major metabolite in both body fluids (8000 ng/mL urine and 450 ng/mL milk); it may be considered as a valuable indicator of the ruminant exposure to PAHs. Apparent absorption of PAHs estimated by the metabolite excretion in urine and milk reached 34% for pyrene from soil, and the bioavailability of soil-bound PAHs was found to be similar to the bioavailability of PAHs from the other matrices. © 2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Perfluorooctanesulphonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are the final products of degradation of numerous fluorochemicals, intensively used in industry. Due to their high stability and low level of biodegradability, they remain in the environment. Their occurrence in milk constitutes one of the numerous initial steps of contamination of many manufactured food products. We contributed to the understanding of the food contamination in analysing the distribution of PFOS and PFOA in food model emulsions. Emulsions stabilised by whey protein isolates were prepared from either contaminated aqueous phase or contaminated sunflower seed oil phase and homogenised at high pressures. Aqueous and creamed phases of emulsions were separated to evaluate the distribution of PFOS and PFOA between these two phases using a combination of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. PFOS and PFOA, initially present in water, migrate in the creamed phase due to their bindings with proteins that cover the oil-water interface of oil droplets. PFOS may also be present at interfaces due to its hydrophobicity. PFOS and PFOA bound to proteins moreover modified the interfacial behaviour of proteins at model air-water interfaces in proportions depending on the concentration and the head group of the perfluorinated surfactants. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The detection of steroid residues in hair is a powerful strategy to demonstrate long-term administration of these growth promoters in meat production animals. Analysis of the ester form of administered steroids is an unambiguous approach to prove the illegal use of natural hormones. For detection, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) was generally used. However, recent advances in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technology have improved the robustness and potential sensitivity of this method. This paper describes development and validation, according to Commission Decision 2002/657/EC, of LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS methods, in two separate laboratories, for determination of steroid esters in bovine hair. Bovine hair samples taken from animals treated with estradiol-3-benzoate and nortestosterone decanoate, as well as from an untreated animal, were used to evaluate the comparability of the results of the two validated methods. The results of the inter-comparison demonstrate that both the LC-MS/MS and the GC-MS/MS methods are fit for purpose and capable of determining steroid esters in hair samples from treated bovine animals. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={A method dedicated to the determination of a multiple range of phytoestrogens as endocrine disruptor compounds in infant food products was developed, with as double objective the specific measurement of 13 parameters and the evaluation of the estrogenic potency associated to this quantitative profile. A combined enzymatic and acidic chemical hydrolysis followed by a double purification on two successive C18 and SiOH Solid Phase Extraction cartridges permitted to efficiently purify milk, cereals and baby-food samples while eliminating naturally occurring estrogen hormones. A specific liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric measurement authorised unambiguous identification and quantification of the target compounds. The proposed methodology was fully validated and applied to a set of around 30 real samples, demonstrating the presence of phytoestrogens at levels globally ranging from several μg kg-1 (ppb) to several tens mg kg-1 (ppm). The prepared sample extracts were proven to be suitable and compatible with the evaluation of their induced biological transcriptional activity on MCF-7 cell lines. Because permitting to cope with difficult issues such as low-dose and mixture effects, this proposed methodology may appear of particular interest for further exposure assessment studies and hazard characterisation investigations related to this class of endocrine disruptor compounds. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Bovine somatotropin (bST), also called growth hormone is a protein hormone produced by the pituitary gland and responsible directly or indirectly for various effects on growth, development and reproductive functions. Its recombinant bovine somatotropin form (rbST) is used in dairy cattle to enhance milk production. Even if the effects of treatment with rbST have been largely studied, until now analytical methods able to detect rbST were limited to immunoassays, which suffer from the impossibility to distinguish between the endogenous and the recombinant form. In this study, a sample preparation procedure based on different precipitation steps, extraction on solid phase and enzymatic digestion was used to purify rbST from serum. The detection was performed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in positive electrospray ionization mode (LC-ESI(+)-MS/MS) allowing the unambiguous identification and quantification of rbST in serum. Samples collected from a cow treated with recombinant bovine somatotropin were analysed and for the first time, the elimination kinetic specific to recombinant somatotropin has been characterized in serum. Detection of rbST was possible from 4 h 30 min to 4 days after administration and concentration was found up to 10 ng mL-1 during the kinetic. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Ecdysteroids, which are steroid hormones in invertebrates, but are also present in plants, could be potentially used as anabolic agents in food-producing animals because of their growth-promoting properties. In this context, the metabolism of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) has been investigated in cattle in order to efficiently control its potential misuse. The analytical procedure involves purification on two solid-phase extraction cartridges (SPE octadecylsilyl and SPE silica) prior to detection based on liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry in negative electrospray ionization mode (LC-(ESI-)-HRMS). Each new signal appearing on full-scan HRMS (30,000) during the analysis was investigated by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Comparison of the mass spectra pattern between 20E and potential metabolites has given informations on the chemical structures of the metabolites. This targeted approach, combining HRMS and MSn measurements on a linear trap in tandem with an orbital trap, allowed us to elucidate the structure of several 20E metabolites in calf urine: 14-deoxy-20-hydroxyecdysone, 20,26-dihydroxyecdysone and 14-deoxy-20,26-dihydroxyecdysone, the last of which had never previously been reported in bovine. The kinetics of elimination of these metabolites were investigated, and two of them were monitored by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) measurements over 6 days after 20E administration to calves, thus increasing the time-window for detection after 20E administration and thereby allowing for more efficient control of its misuse. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The control of ecdysteroid misuse in cattle relies on the development of an efficient method for their detection in biological matrices at trace levels (μg L-1). In order to propose an analytical procedure dedicated to the identification of excreted 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) in urine and faecal samples of breeding animals, a comparative study of the spectrometric behaviour of these compounds was carried out both by LC/(ESI-)/HRMSn (hybrid linear ion trap - orbital trap) and by LC/(ESI+)/MS/MS (triple quadrupole). This study revealed the formation of a large number of product ions both in positive and negative ion mode, corresponding to losses of water molecules and specific cleavages on the side chain. The sample preparation consisted of sequential purification on two solid-phase extraction cartridges (SPE octadecylsilyl and SPE silica). The detection limits were around 0.5 μg L-1 in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode and recoveries above 60% were obtained. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of real samples collected from calves treated with 60 mg 20E over 4 days. Analysis of the samples allowed the investigation of the kinetics of elimination of 20E in calf urine and determination of the time-frame for the control of potential abuse.

abstract={Equine growth hormone (eGH) has been available since 1998 as an approved drug (EquiGen-5, Bresagen) containing recombinant eGH (reGH). It is suspected of being illegally administered to racehorses in order to improve physical performance and to speed-up wound healing. Thus it may be considered a doping agent which would require a sensitive and reliable method of identification and confirmation in order to regulate its use in race-horses. reGH differs from the native eGH by an additional methionine at the N-terminal (met-eGH) and has never been unambiguously detected in any type of biological matrix at trace concentrations (1-10 μg/L). A plasma sample (4 mL) was treated with ammonium sulfate at the reGH isoelectric point and the pellet was purified by solid-phase extraction. Specific peptides were generated by trypsin digestion and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The detection limit was 1 μg/L. The method was validated according to European Union regulation (DEC/2002/657/EC) and the Association of Official Racing Chemists (AORC) requirements. Furthermore, it was successfully applied to determining the plasma concentrations of reGH with time using linear ion trap mass analyzer. The presence of this prohibited hormone (reGH) was also successfully detected by triple quadrupole mass spectrometry up to 48 h postadministration of reGH to a horse. The present LC-MS/MS method is the first with adequate sensitivity and specificity for detection of reGH, rbGH, and endogenous eGH. Hence, an efficient analytical tool is proposed as a means to fulfilling the regulation of reGH abuse in the horse racing industry. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) is used in dairy cattle to enhance milk production. Despite the ban on this hormone in some countries, especially in Europe, there is so far no method available for the direct detection of rbST either in milk or in plasma. An analytical strategy has been developed to analyze rbST in plasma, including a purification procedure based on a precipitation with ammonium sulphate, followed by a solid-phase extraction (SPE)-based clean-up on C4 sorbent and precipitation with cold methanol. The hormone was then digested with trypsin and analyzed by liquid chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC/HRMSn) on a linear ion trap coupled with an Orbitrap. The tryptic N-terminal peptide, specific to the difference between the endogenous and recombinant form of the somatotropin, was fragmented and product ions were analyzed at high mass resolution. Applying this approach to goat plasma allowed the direct detection of 10 ng mL-1 of rbST in fortified samples. It also showed the presence of rbST in plasma collected from a goat treated with the hormone, even 2 days after administration. These results are of a great interest in the field of somatotropin control and undoubtedly constitute a first step in the development of a method for the detection of rbST not only in bovine plasma, but also in other biological matrices such as milk.

abstract={A French monitoring study was initiated to evaluate the exposure of fetus and newborn to brominated flame retardants (BFR). A previously developed multi-residue analytical method was used for measuring the main classes of BFR (tetrabromobisphenol-A, and tri- to decabomodiphenyl ethers) in various human biological matrices. Analyzed samples (maternal and cord serum, adipose tissue and breast milk) were collected from 93 volunteer women during caesarean deliveries. TBBPA was detected in 44% of the analyzed breast milk samples, at levels varying from 0.06 to 37.34 ng g-1 lipid weight, but was not detected in adipose tissue. This compound was also detected in 30% of the analyzed serum samples, with similar average values in maternal and cord serum (154 pg g-1 fresh weight versus 199 pg g-1 fresh weight, respectively). The interpretation of the collected data permitted the demonstration of (1) a significant exposure to TBBPA both for mothers and fetuses and (2) a possible risk of overexposure of newborns through breastfeeding. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Fipronil, a phenylpyrazole insecticide introduced for pest control on a broad range of crops, undergoes a reinforcement of the regulation within the European Union (2007/52/EC directive) due to its potential effects on environment and human health. In order to assess the plasmatic concentrations of fipronil residues (sulfone, sulfide, fipronil, desulfinyl and amide) in ovine, a methodology based on gas chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) was developed and validated according to the European standard (2002/657/EC). The proposed method allows a large number of samples to be treated concurrently (n = 80) using a reduced sample amounts (0.2 mL), and consents to reach a level of quantification of 0.1 pg μL-1. The sample preparation consisted of a single solid-phase extraction (SPE) purification on a 96-well plate filled with a styrene-divinyl-benzene phase. Linearity was demonstrated all along the investigated range of concentrations, i.e. from 0.25 to 2000 pg μL-1, with coefficient of determination (R2) from 0.977 to 0.994, depending on target analytes. Calculated decision limit (CCα) and detection capability (CCβ) for fipronil, sulfone and sulphide were in the range 0.05-0.16 and 0.28-0.73 pg μL-1 respectively. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Emphasis was laid on edible matrices and more specifically on meat, liver, kidney, fat and milk. Additionally, the possibilities of novel analytical approaches are discussed. The review also covers specific attention on the determination of natural steroids.

abstract={The nutritional intake of phytoestrogens seems to reduce the risk of breast cancer or other neoplastic diseases. However, these epidemiological findings remain controversial because low doses of phytoestrogens, achievable through soy-rich diets, stimulate the proliferation of estrogen-sensitive tumor cells. The question of whether such phytochemicals prevent cancer or rather pose additional health hazards prompted us to examine global gene expression programs induced by a typical soy product. After extraction from soymilk, phytoestrogens were deconjugated and processed through reverse- and normal-phase cartridges. The resulting mixture was used to treat human target cells that represent a common model system for mammary tumorigenesis. Analysis of mRNA on high-density microarrays revealed that soy phytoestrogens induce a genomic fingerprint that is indistinguishable from the transcriptional effects of the endogenous hormone 17β-estradiol. Highly congruent responses were also observed by comparing the physiologic estradiol with daidzein, coumestrol, enterolactone, or resveratrol, each representing distinct phytoestrogen structures. More diverging transcriptional profiles were generated when an inducible promoter was used to reconstitute the expression of estrogen receptor β (ERβ). Therefore, phytoestrogens appear to mitigate estrogenic signaling in the presence of both ER subtypes but, in late-stage cancer cells lacking ERβ, these phytochemicals contribute to a tumor-promoting transcriptional signature. © 2008 Society for Endocrinology.},

abstract={Ractopamine (RCT) is a member of the β-2-agonist (β-agonist) family. It is licensed for use as an animal growth promoter in more than 20 countries worldwide, including the United States and Canada, but is either not licensed or prohibited by over 150 others, including those within the European Union. The issue of the use of RCT in livestock bound for human consumption has risen to prominence recently following the decision by The People's Republic of China to ban the import of pork from a number of processing plants after finding traces of RCT in shipments from the U.S.A. In order to monitor for the illegal use of such compounds within Europe, there is a requirement to have a robust and reliable testing scheme capable of the detection of low concentrations of RCT. In the present study an optical biosensor screening assay was developed. The developed assay was compared with a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) confirmatory procedure. These methods were used to study the ability to detect RCT in pigs following treatment. Both testing procedures were capable of detecting low μg kg-1 concentrations of the drug in urine and liver. Liver was found to be a less suitable sample matrix, with RCT residue levels being undetectable after 5 days withdrawal of the drug. Urine samples however still contained detectable RCT residues several weeks after withdrawal. The correlation (as measured by r2) between the biosensor and LC-MS/MS methods was 0.99 and 0.97 for urine and liver samples, respectively. It is concluded that testing regimes based on RCT analysis in liver are less likely to detect illegal administration of the drug than those based on urine analysis. Urine samples provide an excellent matrix for the detection of RCT residues for an extended period post withdrawal. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Since the Australian commercialisation of the recombinant equine growth hormone (reGH) in 1998 (EquiGen-5®, Bresagen), this reGH, which differs only from eGH by an additional methionine at the N-terminal end (met-eGH), is worldwide suspected to be administered to racehorses as a doping agent. Indeed, the use of this biological drug is considered as a threat to horseracing since it acts both on growth, development or reproductive functions, and on the improvement of performances. In this work, we describe two reliable techniques based on surface plasmon resonance biosensor immunoassay (SPR-BIA) and solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as new, rapid and efficient long-term screening methods applicable to horseracing antidoping analysis. The ELISA and SPR-BIA tests were applied to octanoic acid purified IgGs from serum/plasma samples collected on two thoroughbreds treated with recombinant equine growth hormone for a period of two weeks. The first kinetic study of serum/plasma antibodies raised as a consequence of recombinant equine growth hormone administrations, which allows the detection from eight days up to 200 days after the beginning of the treatment, was performed. In order to trace the occurrence of anti-reGH antibodies in routine analysis and to monitor the animal level exposure to this forbidden molecule, a random population study was conducted on 233 post-race horses. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

In order to assess the potential risk linked to these compounds in human, a French monitoring study was initiated to evaluate the exposure of fetus and newborn. A previously described multi-residue analytical method was used, for measuring the main classes of BFR (hexabromocyclododecane, tetrabromobisphenol-A, and tri- to deca-polybromodiphenylethers) in various biological matrices. These analyzed samples (maternal and umbilical serum, adipose tissue and breast milk) were collected on volunteer women during caesarean deliveries. Preliminary results obtained on 26 individuals (mother/newborn pairs) mainly demonstrated the presence of polybromodiphenylethers (PBDE) and tetrabromobisphenol A both in maternal and fetal matrices, and a possible risk of overexposure of newborns through breastfeeding. Contaminations levels were found globally in the ng/g lipid weight range, consistent with other published European data. Exposure results regarding highly brominated PBDE congeners (octa- to deca-BDE) appeared particularly informative and non-commonly reported, these compounds accounting for around 50% of the total PBDE load. Additional data collection and metabolism investigations are now ongoing. A more complete statistical analysis related to this BFR exposition study will be provided in a next future. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.},

abstract={The occurrence of the main steroid hormones (oestrone, 17α-oestradiol, 17β-oestradiol, 17α-testosterone, 17β-testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, 4-androstenedione), especially in milk and eggs, was investigated. An analytical method based on GC-MS/MS was developed for steroid measurement at an ultra-trace level in food products. The limits of detection for oestrogens were about 5 and 30 ng kg-1 in milk and eggs, respectively. For androgens, the limits of detection were around 10 and 50 ng kg-1 in milk and eggs, respectively. The method was applied to milk and egg samples collected in a French supermarket. In milk, oestrone was found at levels between 100 and 300 ng l-1, while 17β-oestradiol levels were estimated to be near 20 ng l-1. 17α-testosterone was found to be from 50 ng l-1 in skimmed milk to 85 ng l-1 in whole milk. In egg samples, oestrone and 17β-oestradiol were found at 1.5 and 0.9 βg kg-1, respectively, while 17α-oestradiol was found to be in lower concentrations (i.e. around 0.55 μg kg-1). Regarding androgens, 17α- and 17β-testosterone were estimated at 1.9 and 1.3 μg kg-1, respectively. These results represent a first attempt to estimate the food exposure to steroid hormones. In the future, the collection of additional data should permit the comparison between this exogenous dietary intake and the daily endogenous production in pre-pubertal children as a basis of risk assessment regarding endocrine disruption linked to these molecules for this critical population.},

abstract={Fipronil, a phenylpyrazole insecticide introduced for pest control on a broad range of crops, can also affect non-target insects such as honeybees. More widely, non-target environment such as milk produced by dairy cows fed with maize silage from treated seeds (=silage T) can be affected. To assess the potential transfer of fipronil residues (sulfone, sulfide, fipronil, desulfinyl and amide), a methodology including gas chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) analysis was developed and validated according to the 2002/657/EC decision, in order to reach a level of quantification below 0.1 μg L-1 in milk and 0.1 μg kg-1 in plants. Twelve dairy cows were fed with silage T during 4 months. Concentration of fipronil in treated seeds was estimated at 1 g kg-1, whereas silage from these seeds contained 0.30 ± 0.05 μg kg-1 of dry material of fipronil, 0.13 ± 0.03 μg kg-1 of dry material of sulfone. Sulfide residues were below the limit of quantification. Silage from untreated seeds (=silage U) presented traces of fipronil and sulfone, respectively at 0.04 ± 0.06 and 0.02 ± 0.03 μg kg-1 of dry material. Contribution of fipronil residues from supplies was insignificant. During administration of silage T, only sulfone residues were quantified in milk. The average concentration was 0.14 ± 0.05 μg L-1. Before and after administration, sulfone residues were detected but not quantifiable (&lt;0.025 μg L-1). Our results suggest a transfer of fipronil from feed to milk under its sulfone form. Moreover, traces of fipronil residues in maize U, soya, wheat and straw show a diffuse contamination of this pesticide in the environment. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The use of anabolic agents in food-producing animals has been prohibited within the EU since 1988. The control of the illegal use of natural steroid hormones in cattle is still an exciting analytical challenge as no definitive method and nonambiguous analytical criteria are available. We have used gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS) to demonstrate the administration of cortisol to cattle. The method consisted of an efficient combination between OASIS HLB solid-phase extraction (SPE), oxidation, SiOH SPE and semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for glucocorticoid purification. By comparison of the 13C/12C isotopic ratio of the oxidised product of cortisol, i.e. 5β-androstane-3,11,17-trione (5βAAT), with an endogenous reference compound (ERC), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), the differentiation of cortisol metabolite origin, either endogenous or exogenous, has been achieved. After treatment of an animal, the δ13C VPDB values of 5βAAT reached -30 to -32‰, whereas the δ13CVPDB values of DHEA remained at -25‰. A significant difference in the δ13CVPDB values between DHEA and 5βAAT was measurable over a period of 3 days after a single administration of cortisol to the animal.

abstract={A residue is a trace (μg kg-1, ng kg-1) of a substance, present in a matrix. Banned substances, such as growth promoters, which are abused in animal fattening and where this article is focused on, may be divided into four major groups: thyreostats, anabolics or anabolic steroids, corticosteroids and beta-agonists or repartitioning agents. The combination of chromatographic techniques with mass spectrometry (GC-MSn, LC-MS n, etc.) plays a key role in the production of specific results in residue analysis. In this review, the past, present and future of mass spectrometry in this area are discussed in the light of the impact of these substances on human health and the reliable production of analytical results, ready for challenge in a court.

This method includes the monitoring of 15 PAHs stated as a priority by the EU in their 2005/108 recommendation. The samples were extracted according to a selective extraction step using pressurized liquid extraction followed by a purification with polystyrene-divinylbenzene SPE. Identification and quantification were performed using GC-MS/MS, with an isotope dilution approach using 13C-labelled PAHs. The novel combination of selective extraction followed by purification provides highly purified analytes combined to a fast and automated method. The advantages of GC-MS/MS as compared to other detection methods are tremendous in terms of sensitivity, selectivity and interpretation facilities. Limits of detection varied between 0.008 and 0.15 μg kg-1, limits of quantification between 0.025 and 0.915 μg kg-1 for PAHs in food. The calibration curves showed a good linearity for all PAHs (R2 &gt; 0.99) and precision and recovery were fit for purpose.

abstract={Four industrial processes for smoking food were studied through their effects on the organoleptic properties of smoked salmon and on the occurrence of 20 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) known as being contaminants of smoking processes. The contamination by PAHs of the food might be measured by their corresponding toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ) expressed in μg kg -1. The results show a significant correlation between the smoking process parameters, the odour of the smoked fish and the presence of PAHs. Smouldering, thermostated plates and friction smoking processes allow smoked fish with very close odorant characteristics to be obtained. However, differences of pyrolysis temperature (between 380 and 500°C) causes significant differences of PAHs concentration even if the contents are under the legal threshold concerning benzo(a)pyrene (5 μg kg-1). Smoked fish obtained by liquid smoke vaporisation presented the lowest level of PAHs but benzo(a)pyrene concentration is nevertheless important. The odours brought by the liquid smoke process are more 'cold smoke' and 'vegetal/green' than the other techniques, which are smokier and fishier. © 2007 Society of Chemical Industry.},

abstract={Rules of horse racing stipulate that pregnant mares may compete under definite conditions of date, because early pregnant status may be misused for the sake of enhancing physical performance by putative anabolic steroid action. Screening for pregnancy is generally performed by plasma equine gonadotrophin (eCG) immunoassay, which covers the period between Days 40 and 120. In common screening for urinary anabolic steroids performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, inclusion of two complementary criteria, i.e. the evaluation of total conjugates of 5(10)-estrene-3β,17α-diol (EED) and estrone (E1), can easily be performed. Although EED and E1 have no anabolic property per se in the horse, assessing these two markers may be helpful in the period comprised between Days 70 and 250, thereby prolonging the detection period behind that of eCG. Peak values of EED and E1 are then attained, so that visual inspection of chromatographic tracings remains in general sufficient as a diagnostic tool. Comparison of EED and E1 during pregnancy and in an estrus cycle indicates a drastic difference in the attained excretion values, attributable to either the placenta or the ovarian follicle. The identity of EED has been proven by GC-MSn in urine and in placental tissue. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Global concern has been raised in recent years over adverse effects that may result from exposure to chemicals that may interfere with the endocrine system. A specific question is related to low-dose effects and long-term exposure consequences, especially for critical populations (foetus, new born, prepubertal children). In this context, we decided to focus our attention on steroid hormones as they are the most potent endocrine disrupters. Our general goal is to investigate whether the steroid intake through food may represent a risk for prepubertal children, from an endocrine disruption point of view, especially with regard to the corresponding endogenous production level in this target population. As a starting point, it was estimated that a (re)-evaluation of the endogenous production of natural estrogens for this population was necessary, on the basis of a very sensitive and specific confirmatory measurement technique (gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry or gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry). Thus, a new ultra-sensitive approach for steroid trace measurement in biological samples was developed, which was mainly based on a specific derivatisation (pentafluorobenzyl derivative) and negative chemical ionisation (NCI). Preliminary results obtained by applying this method on plasma samples from healthy prepubertal children demonstrated that estradiol endogenous level in prepubertal children is unsurprisingly very low. Estrone was determined in almost all samples at concentration in the 2-70 ng L-1 range while 17α and 17β estradiol were quantified in only few samples at concentrations ranging from 2 to 6 ng L-1. Exogenous contributions of estrogens will therefore constitute a relatively higher proportion of sex hormone activity in the immature child. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In most cases these substances are marketed on websites or are confiscated during inspections. 1,(5α)-Androstene-17β-ol-3-one, also known as 1-testosterone, is one of these substances presented to body-builders as a nutritional supplement or a pro-hormone. 1-Testosterone closely resembles the natural hormone testosterone except for a 1,2-double bound instead of a 4,5-double bound. 1-Androstene-3β,17β-diol is transformed into 1-testosterone after oral administration. 1-Testosterone, 1-androstene-3β,17β-diol and some other related 'new' anabolic steroids were studied with gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS2) methods. Similarities in spectra to known analytes, which may lead to pitfalls in the interpretation of the derivatised analytes, are discussed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Cholesterol is a well-known component in fats of animal origin and it also is the precursor of natural hormones. Phytosterols appear in plants and only differ slightly in structure from cholesterol. An important difference however is the low absorption in the gut of phytosterols and their saturated derivatives, the phytostanols. As a result, there is time for all kind of reactions in faecal material inside and outside of the gut. Determination of the abuse of natural hormones may be based on gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS). Abuse of natural hormones changes the 13C/12C ratio of some metabolites during a relatively long time. The formation of (natural) hormones in the gut may interfere with this method. Designer drugs are mainly known from sports doping. In animal fattening, designer drugs may be used as well. Small changes in the structure of (natural) hormones may lead to a new group of substances asking for new strategies for their detection and the constatation of their abuse. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The aim of this study was to establish the transfer of phenanthrene, pyrene, and benzo[a]pyrene and their major hydroxylated metabolites to milk and to urine after a single oral administration (100 mg per animal of each compound) in 4 lactating goats. Detection and identification of the analytes (native compounds, 1-OH pyrene, 3-OH phenanthrene, 3-OH benzo [a]pyrene) were achieved using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Benzo [a] pyrene, phenanthrene, and pyrene were rapidly detected in the plasma stream, whereas 1-OH pyrene and 3-OH phenanthrene appeared later in plasma. These data suggest that pyrene and phenanthrene are progressively metabolized within the organism. Recovery rates of pyrene and phenanthrene in milk over a 24-h period appeared to be very low (0.014 and 0.006%, respectively), whereas the transfer rates of their corresponding metabolites were significantly higher: 0.44% for 1-OH pyrene and 0.073% for 3-OH phenanthrene. Recovery rates in urine were found to be higher (1 to 10 times) than recovery rates in milk. The 1-OH pyrene was found to be the main metabolite in urine as well as in milk. Thus, as has been established for humans, 1-OH pyrene could be considered as a marker of ruminant exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Because 1-OH pyrene and 3-OH phenanthrene were measured in milk (unlike their corresponding native molecules), metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons should be taken into consideration when evaluating the safety of milk. Benzo [a] pyrene and 3-OH benzo [a]pyrene were (less than 0.005%) transferred to milk and urine in very slight amounts. This very limited transfer rate of both compounds suggests a low risk of exposure by humans to benzo [a] pyrene or its major metabolite from milk or milk products. © American Dairy Science Association, 2007.},

abstract={Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are ubiquitous plant lipid-binding proteins that have been associated with multiple developmental and stress responses. Although LTPs typically bind fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives in a non-covalent way, studies on the LTPs of barley seeds have identified an abundantly occurring covalently modified form, LTP1b, the lipid ligand of which has resisted clarification. In the present study, this adduct was identified as the α-ketol 9-hydroxy-10-oxo-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid. Further studies on the formation of LTP1b demonstrated that the ligand was introduced by nucleophilic attack of the free carboxylate group of the Asp-7 residue of the protein at carbon-9 of the allene oxide fatty acid 9(S),10-epoxy-10,12(Z)- octadecadienoic acid. This reactive oxylipin was produced in barley seeds by oxygenation of linoleic acid by 9-lipoxygenase followed by dehydration of the resulting hydroperoxide by allene oxide synthase. The generation of protein-oxylipin adducts represents a new function for plant allene oxide synthases, enzymes that have earlier been implicated mainly in the biosynthesis of the jasmonate family of plant hormones. Additionally, the LTP-allene oxide synthase interaction opens new perspectives regarding the roles of LTPs in the signaling of plant defense and development. © 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract={Boldenone is an androgenic steroid that improves the growth and food conversion in food producing animals. In most countries worldwide, this anabolic steroid is forbidden for meat production. Until recently, the control of its illegal use was based either on 17β-boldenone or 17α-boldenone (its main metabolite in cattle) identification in edible tissues, hair, faeces or urine. Recent observations and data tend to demonstrate the natural occurrence (but not ubiquitous) in cattle of these steroids, making the analytical strategy of the control more complicated. We investigated the metabolism of boldenone in cattle after intramuscular and oral treatment of boldenone, boldenone esters and boldione. The central objective was to elucidate the structures of the main metabolites (phase I and phase II) in urine, with main objective to be further in position to compare boldenone urinary profiles of treated and non-treated animals. Nine metabolites have been identified, only four were present whatever the treatment and the administered boldenone source. Nevertheless, all of them have been detected at least once in non-treated animals which did not permit us to use them as biomarkers of an illegal treatment. At last, but not at least, all metabolites were found mainly glucuro-conjugated, and rarely sulfo-conjugated, with the only exception of 17β-boldenone. Current investigations are showing the absence of 17β-boldenone sulfoconjugate in non-treated animals; that would permit to distinguish non-treated from treated animals with boldione, boldenone and boldenone esters. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={During the last fifty years, considerable progress in breeding performances of domestic species has been obtained due to a better knowledge obtained in physiology and in particular nutrition, growth, reproduction and lactation. This progress has been united with that of genetic progress accomplished in the different animal species in a context of an improved control of sanitary conditions of herds and a more accurate control of the existing breeding systems. The use of hormonal substances to better control reproduction functions and growth has become decisive within this progress. However, a profound tendency that restrains their use to certain critical moments in the life of an animal has appeared in Europe these last fifteen years, obliging researchers to search for alternatives via a better control of food, genetics and breeding systems, in order to guarantee to consumers a better, a priori, quality of animal products. Physiological functions that offer possibilities of exogenous hormonal control, usable hormonal substances and animal speculations are presented. A clarification of the toxicological risks that these substances present, the control and traceability of their use and the current regulations are given. Finally, the research that will allow making progress around the question of hormone use in breeding in a context of a remodelled society is evoked.},

abstract={The impact of chronic exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on milk contamination was evaluated by oral administration of a mixture of fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, chrysene, benzo(k)fluorene, benzo(a)pyrene and benzo(g,h,i)perylene at 0.02 mg/kg to lactating goats for 28 days. We analysed PAHs and their major metabolites in milk by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results evidence several major points: (1) benzo(k)fluorene, benzo(a)pyrene and benzo(g,h,i)perylene were not detected in the milk; (2) unexpectedly, the concentration of fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene and chrysene did not change with time; (3) monohydroxylated PAH metabolites (-OH), namely 2-OH-fluorene, 3-OH-phenanthrene and 1-OH-pyrene were detected shortly after administration. The concentrations of 2-OH-fluorene and 3-OH-phenanthrene reached, respectively, maxima of 0.41 and 0.22 ng/mL during the first exposure week, whereas the concentration of 1-OH pyrene increased to reach a maximum of 0.97 ng/mL on day 14, then slightly decreased during the last two exposure weeks. Those findings suggest a lack of activation of a metabolism that could lead to an excretion of PAHs into milk under native forms. However, a slight increase in concentration could induce the metabolism, which should lead to an increase in the excretion of metabolites into the milk. In spite of the absence of a significant transfer of parent PAHs to milk, the appearance of metabolites in milk raises questions of their impact on human health. © INRA, EDP Sciences, 2006.},

The objective of the present study was to document their presence, their level and their transfer in the food web of two major estuaries in France, the Loire and the Seine. PBDEs were quantified in eight principal species from the Loire, representing primary consumers (the bivalve Scrobicularia plana), omnivores (the worm Nereis diversicolor, the shrimps Crangon crangon, Palaemon elegans and Palaemon serratus, the flatfish Platichthys flesus and Solea solea) and supercarnivores (the eel Anguilla anguilla). In the Seine, only worms, bivalves, sole and eels have been studied. Parameters, which can interfere with the interpretation of contamination data (organ distribution, influence of weight or size of specimens, lipid richness, intrinsic variability), have been examined. BDE-47 was the predominant congener in all biota. Higher contamination was observed in most of the species collected from the Seine, in agreement with the higher human presence and economic activity in the Seine than in the Loire basin. PBDEs have been shown to biomagnify in both of the studied estuarine food webs. However, assessment of PBDE transfer from seafood products exposed to contaminants in the Seine estuary showed that human daily intake is far below the no observed adverse effect levels. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies demonstrated the impact of some avermectin and pyrethroid compounds on several species such as Onthophagus gazella and Neomyia cornicina . However, little information is available regarding the elimination of these compounds in faeces 8 days after a pour-on administration in dairy cows. The present study, utilising a dairy cow model with cypermethrin treatment, demonstrated that concentrations in dry faeces can reach levels of 5 mg kg -1 between the first and fourth day after treatment and were present up to 3 months after a single dose of administration at a concentration around 10 μg kg -1 . Faecal samples were purified with three successive columns (silica gel, anion exchange phase, and basic alumina) and analysed by GC-MS. The limit of quantification of this method was 0.5 μg kg -1 . The high sensitivity of the method permitted one to see that the risk exposure of cypermethrin to dung beetles is longer than what was noted in the literature. According to other studies, repeated treatment with such agents may lead to the local extinction of dung beetles. Even if the impact of pyrethroid largely depends on the conditions of the ecosystem where the treated cattle are living, adverse effects of these agents may still occur. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The use of anabolic substances is prohibited in food-producing animals throughout the European Union. No method is available to reliably detect the misuse of natural hormones in cattle. A method was developed to detect the abuse of testosterone in cattle fattening. Synthesized testosterone is rather depleted in the 13C/12C ratio. Hence, the method is based on gas chromatography/combustion/ isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS) analysis of urine. To select testosterone metabolites and endogenous reference compounds (ERC), the concentration of urinary steroids of cattle was investigated. Dehydroepiandrosterone and androst-5ene-3β,17α-diol were chosen as ERCs to show endogenous 13C/12C ratios. Etiocholanolone and 5α-androstane-3β,17α-diol were chosen as the most important testosterone metabolites. Other metabolites known from literature like epitestosterone were less promising. In principle, GC/C/IRMS is a nonspecific method because finally carbon dioxide is analyzed. Therefore, a dedicated cleanup procedure for the selected steroids was developed. By means of proposed confidence intervals in the isotopic composition of ERCs and metabolites, the administration of testosterone to cattle could be detected reliably. Differences of up to 11‰ on the δ-scale between ERC and testosterone metabolites were found after testosterone administration, whereas endogenous differences did not exceed 2‰. © 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to determine the transfer kinetics of soil-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to milk in lactating cows. Soil (500 g/day) fortified with fluorene (104 μg/g dry soil), phenanthrene (82 μg/g), pyrene (78 μg/g), and benzo[a]pyrene (33 μg/g) was administered to three dairy cows via a rumen cannulas for 28 consecutive days. Parent compounds and their major metabolites in milk were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Secretion of parent compounds in milk did not increase significantly (P > 0.05) over the control values measured before supply. Target monohydroxylated metabolites were not detected in control samples, but 2-hydroxy fluorene, 3-hydroxy phenanthrene, and 1-hydroxy pyrene were present in milk by the second day of dosing. The highest concentrations of metabolites in milk (31-39 ng/mL) were for 1-hydroxy pyrene at days 7 and 14 of dosing. The observed plateaus for 3-hydroxy phenanthrene and 2-hydroxy fluorene were lower (respectively, 0.69 and 2.79 ng/mL) but significantly increased in comparison to the control samples. Contrarily, 3-hydroxy benzo[a]pyrene was not detected in milk at any sampling time. These results suggested a notable metabolism of the parent compounds after their extraction from soil during the digestive transfer. Thus, the metabolization of fluorene and pyrene can lead to higher concentrations of metabolites than of parent compounds in milk. Despite the absence of a significant transfer of parent PAHs to milk, the appearance of metabolites raises the questions of their impact on human health. © 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF) are widely recognized by the scientific community as persistent organic pollutants due to their toxicity and adverse effects on wildlife and human health. The actual regulation dedicated to the monitoring of dioxins in food is based on the measurement of 17 congener concentrations. The final result is reported as a toxic equivalent value that takes into account the relative toxicity of each congener. This procedure can minimize the qualitative information available from the abundances of each PCDD/PCDF congener: the characteristic contamination profile of the sample. Multivariate statistical techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA) or linear discriminant analysis (LDA), represent an interesting way to investigate this qualitative information. Nevertheless, they have only been applied to the analysis of contamination data from food products and biological matrices infrequently. The objective of the present study was to analyze a large data set from dioxin analyses performed on various food products of animal origin. The results demonstrate the existence of differences in congener-specific patterns between the analyzed samples. Variability was first demonstrated in terms of the food type (fish, meat, milk, fatty products). Then a variability was observed that was related to the specific animal species for meat and milk samples (bovine, ovine, porcine, caprine and poultry). Some practical applications of these results are discussed. The origin(s) of the observed differences, as well as their significance, now remain to be investigated, both in terms of environmental factors and transfer through living organisms. A better knowledge of the relation between a contamination profile and its specific source and/or food product should be of great interest to scientists working in the fields of contaminant analysis, toxicology and metabolism, as well as to regulatory bodies and risk assessors in charge of final decisions regarding the eventual hazards associated with theses substances.},

After oral and subcutaneous administration of NClTA to bovine, urine samples were collected over a period of three weeks, and chemical structure of main excreted urinary metabolites was determined. After oral administration, the most abundant metabolites were mainly reduced as 4-chloro-19-norandrostan-3ξ-ol-17-one and 4-chloro-19-norandrostan-3ξ,17ξ-diol. They were identified until 1 week after administration. Following subcutaneous injection, 4-chloro-19- norandrostan-3ξ-ol-17-one was again of major abundance, but so were 4-chloro-19-norandrost-4-ene-3ξ,17ξ-diol and 4-chloro-19-norandrost-4-en- 3ξ-ol-17-one. They were detected at least 3 weeks after administration. Whatever the route of administration, metabolites were found mainly glucurono-conjugated; the only exception was metabolite 4-chloro-19- norandrostan-3ξ-ol-17-one which was identified both in the sulpho- and glucurono-fractions. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The chromatographic and mass spectrometric (MS) behaviors of 49 polybrominated diphenylether (PBDE) homologues toward various techniques is investigated. Special attention is paid to chromatographic separation, ionization processes, and signal acquisition modes. Different liquid chromatographic (LC) separation systems and gas chromatographic (GC) temperature program parameters are studied. For LC-MS experiments, the ionization efficiencies of electrospray, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, and atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) are evaluated. For GC-MS experiments, negative chemical ionization with ammonia as reagent gas as well as negative and positive electron impact (EI) ionization are studied. Thus, fragmentation pathways of PBDEs are investigated, with the main objective being to determine the sensitivity/specificity balance of each tested technique with respect to their potential respective application (parent compound focusing, metabolite identification, and screening of analogue compounds). Finally, performances of the different tested techniques are compared and evaluated in terms of detection limits on standard solutions for each homologue group. In terms of ionization, EI remains the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity with possible complementary applications in MS-MS and high-resolution MS. Nevertheless, APPI appears to be a promising alternative.},

abstract={The use of anabolic agents in food producing animals is prohibited within the EU since 1988 (96/22/EC directive). The control of the illegal use of natural steroid hormones in cattle is still an exciting analytical challenge as far as no definitive method and non-ambiguous analytical criteria are available. The ability of gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS) to demonstrate the administration of 17β-estradiol to bovine has been investigated in this paper. By comparison of 13C/ 12C isotopic ratio of main urinary estradiol metabolite, i.e. 17α-estradiol, with two endogenous reference compounds (ERCs), i.e. dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and 5-androstene-3β,17α-diol, the differentiation of estradiol metabolite origin, either endogenous or exogenous, has been proved to be achievable. After treatment, the δ 13CVPDB-values of 17α-estradiol reached -27‰ to -29‰, whereas δ13CVPDB-values of DHEA remained between -13‰ and -20‰ depending on the diet, maize and grass, respectively. A significant difference of δ13C VPDB between ERCs and 17α-estradiol was measurable over a period of 2 weeks after estradiol ester administration to the animal. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Following findings of 17β-19-nortestosterone (150-200 μg kg-1) in pigs of unspecified gender imported into the European Union, a study to determine steroid and hormone levels in swine from six age/gender categories (uncastrated 'old' boars, cryptorchids, one intersex, barrows, gilts and sows) was initiated. Indeed, for some hormones there has been a discussion about their being endo- or exogenous. Tissue and urine samples from swine from each of the six categories were obtained in Belgium, France, the Netherlands and the USA. Samples were analysed in three laboratories. Quantitation was obtained for norandrostenedione, 19-nortestosterone and boldenone. The results give a well-documented overview of the status of the presence of these hormones in swine. The data illustrate that uncastrated 'old' boars produce the highest percentage of 'positive' matrices, followed by the cryptorchids. Concentrations in the matrices of the barrows and the gilts are lower. Also, sow matrices contain low amounts of nor-steroids. Furthermore, urine samples from an intersex pig contains a higher concentration of nortestosterone than sows and can therefore be suspected for illegal use of these hormones. Veterinarians taking samples in pig farms for the analysis of hormones need to be aware of the presence and concentrations of these substances in the different categories. © 2005 Taylor &amp; Francis.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to determine the tissue distribution of 17 PCDD/Fs following the chronic ingestion of contaminated milk in rats and to assess the "target tissue/milk" BioConcentration Factors (BCFs) of these molecules. Contaminated milk, collected in a polluted area, has been incorporated into the diet of male rats at a low dose (31 pg I-TEQ/day/rat). For this exposure, the accumulation of PCDD/Fs in target tissues (liver and adipose tissue) was limited, the tissue concentrations stabilising between 90 and 120 days of daily intake to levels close to 3 pg/g of tissue (all tissues and molecules combined). The tissue distribution seemed to be governed by the congeners properties and by the tissue characteristics. An increase in the chlorination degree of dioxins caused a decrease in their incorporation in the adipose tissue, and consequently of the BCF values. Moreover, the distribution of dioxins between hepatocytes and adipocytes differed: unlike the liver, the quantities of dioxins in the adipose tissue were significantly (P < 0.05) correlated to the quantity of tissue fat. Only in the liver, the incorporation of PCDDs seemed to be facilitated when the chlorination degree of these congeners increased, the reverse phenomenon having been observed for PCDFs. However, for the same level of chlorination, the BCFs of PCDFs were 2.4 times higher than those of PCDDs in this tissue. The absence of correlation between the quantity of dioxins and that of fat and the BCFs differences of theses congeners suggested that dioxins fixation process in the liver was selective. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

From such a specific biological signature of anabolic response, it is possible to interpret some of these biochemical disruptions.

abstract={Atmospheric pressure photo ionisation has been evaluated for the analysis of brominated flame retardants and their related degradation products by LC-MS. Degradation mixtures obtained from the photochemical degradation of tetrabromobisphenol A and decabromodiphenylether were used as model systems for the assessment of the developed methodology. Negative ion mode gave best results for TBBPA and its degradation compounds. [M - H]- ions were formed without the need of using a doping agent. MS and MS/MS experiments allowed the structural identification of new TBBPA "polymeric" degradation compounds formed by attachment of TBBPA moieties and/or their respective cleavage products. In the case of polybromodiphenylethers, the positive mode provided M+ ions and gave better results for congeners ranging from mono- to pentabromodiphenylethers whereas for higher bromination degrees, the negative ion mode (providing [M - Br + O]- ions) was best suited. Under both positive and negative ionisation modes, the use of toluene as doping agent gave better results. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry by means of atmospheric pressure photo-ionisation was applied to the analysis of aromatic brominated flame retardants and their degradation products. This methodology proved to be particularly useful, for the characterisation and structural identification of some compounds which are not amenable to GC-MS, especially in the case of apolar "polymeric" degradation products of tetrabromobisphenol A investigated in this work. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The detection of steroid residues in hair is a powerful strategy to demonstrate long-term administration of these growth promoters in meat production animals. A fast and reliable method was developed for monitoring anabolic steroids and their esters in hair. A 100 mg hair sample was converted into powder and extracted at 50°C with methanol (sebum fraction). The remaining hair was digested with 1 M NaOH for further extraction of bound steroids. The two fractions were separately purified onto an aminopropyle solid-phase extraction column and onto a silica SPE cartridge. Steroids were detected either by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry after silylation using N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide/trimethyliodosilane/ dithiothreitol or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. This method was applied to hair samples collected over a three months period after treatment of three cows respectively with 17α-methyltestosterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate and 17β-estradiol-3-benzoate. The fixation kinetic into hair of the three steroids have been deeply examined and discussed; relation in-between concentration and distance from the injection site, influence of hair colour and sample treatment consequences have been discussed. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The differentiation of stereoisomers on the basis of their mass spectra only is usually a difficult challenge even when an informative ionization technique such as electron ionization is used; this is particularly the case for steroids. In this study, multivariate statistical techniques have been applied to the mass spectra of derivatized 5ξ-androstane-3ξ,17ξ-diols (ξ = αβ) in order to investigate the possibility of discrimination among the different isomers. After collection of the data from the mass spectra (20 replicates for each of the 8 isomers), each ion was considered as a statistical variable and each mass spectrum as an observation. The more discriminative variables (42 out of the 160 initial ones) were selected using the analysis of variance technique (ANOVA). Thereafter, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) allowed us to set up a predictive model for stereochemistry determination. The two-dimensional graphical display of the 160 observations on the basis of the canonical variables derived from LDA made it possible to separate the eight isomers. The discrimination of 5α and 5β isomers as well as 3α and 3β was unambiguous, whereas, the discrimination of 17α and 17β epimers was less obvious. The robustness of the model was checked with 40 mass spectra recorded over a 6-month period on different quadrupole mass spectrometers and under different signal acquisition conditions. The percentage of correct assignment of these 'unknown' stereoisomers was 92%; only three 17α and 17β epimers were not correctly plotted in the expected zone. Nevertheless, the performance score was better than those observed with traditional mass spectral libraries. Furthermore, this statistical approach allowed us to identify the main fragment ions involved in the discrimination between isomers: m/z 256 and 421 for isomers 5a-5b; m/z 241 and 331 for isomers 5α3α-5α3β; m/z 143 and 162 for isomers 5β3α-5β3β and m/z 255 for epimers 17α-17β.

abstract={A fast and efficient multiresidue extraction-purification procedure was developed for low levels (ppb range) of phenanthrene and hydroxyphenanthrene in biological matrices, in order to quantify phenanthrene and metabolites in blood, milk, urine, and biological tissues of lactating goats. Detection and identification of the analytes (phenanthrene and 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 9-hydroxyphenanthrene) were achieved using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Deuterium-labeled phenanthrene was used as internal standard for phenanthrene and 2-OHfluorene for metabolites. The developed method includes enzymatic hydrolysis, liquid-liquid extraction, and Envi-Chrom P SPE column purification. Analyses were performed in the selected ion monitoring mode to achieve ad hoc sensitivity in accordance with analyte concentrations in food samples. Detection limits were between 2.3 and 5.1 ng/mL (ppb) for milk samples, 0.5 and 2.5 ng/mL for urine and blood samples, and 1.9 and 8.0 ng/g for tissue samples. This original multiresidue and multimatrix analytical methodology was applied to metabolism studies and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) risk assessment. We demonstrated, for the first time, that metabolites were present in milk. These results suggested that usual PAHs analysis methods based on the detection of native molecule are not representative of the real contamination of biological matrices.},

abstract={In the parasitic plant Striga hermonthica (Del. Benth), asparagine synthesis plays a prominent role in the metabolism of the host-derived nitrogen and in the detoxification process of a steady-state N-excess. Here, we show that asparagine synthetase (EC 6.3.5.4), the primary enzyme involved in asparagine production in plants, is encoded in Striga by a small gene family, with at least two AS genes, including the gene called ShAS related to the small class II Asparagine Synthetase genes. The functionality of ShAS was demonstrated by complementation of an E. coli asn auxotroph mutant and its expression was characterized by semiquantitative RT-PCR. The ShAS expression pattern in plants growing under standard light conditions and in light-grown calli differs from the expression pattern of most plant AS genes since ShAS transcripts accumulated in all the plant organs and this accumulation was not repressed by light. In contrast, ShAS expression was light-induced in mature leaves and in the chlorophyllous calli. The promoter region of ShAS was also sequenced and characterized and displayed various light-responsive, as well as potential sugar-responsive, cis-elements. A correlation between ShAS expression and asparagine synthesis was demonstrated in the illuminated mature leaves by 15N-labelling in vivo experiments. ShAS was also shown to be positively regulated in light-grown calli by C- and N-starvation and was associated with senescence-related protein breakdown. ShAS expression was not repressed by light in haustoria, roots, senescing leaves and inflorescences. These findings show that one or more unknown factors of regulation can override light as the major regulator.},

Different laboratories in the European Union have examined the occurrence of boldenone and its metabolites. The results were discussed at different meetings of a European Commission DG-SANCO Working Party and summarized in an expert report. The situation of the different laboratories at this time is also covered herein. The overall conclusion of the Working Party was that there was a necessity for further research to distinguish between naturally occurring and illegally used boldenone forms. The confirmation of the presence of boldenone metabolites (free and conjugated forms) in certain matrices of animals is proposed as a marker for the illegal treatment with boldenone. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.},

It implies very specific and sensitive analytical methods able to detect and identify sub-μg kg-1 residue levels in complex biological matrices such as meat, urine, or hair.

In this paper we review how developments in mass spectrometry have been rapidly applied to this problem, how efficient analysis of anabolic steroids in urine, edible tissue, and hair has been achieved, and, later, how measurement of conjugate steroids and determination of the origin of natural steroid hormones has been achieved. The performance characteristics of different mass spectrometers (quadrupole, ion-trap, electromagnetic, isotope-ratio, tandem, and hybrid instruments), the efficiency of different acquisition techniques (LR-SIM, HR-SIM, MRM), and, finally, sample introduction (gas chromatography and liquid chromatography, with discussion of alternative interfaces) are discussed, with numerous applications.},

abstract={Studies reveal that surface waters worldwide are contaminated with hormonally active agents, many released from sewage treatment plants. Another potential source of aquatic hormonal contamination is livestock feedlot effluent. In this study, we assessed whether feedlot effluent contaminates watercourses by measuring a) total androgenic [methyltrienolone (R1881) equivalents] and estrogenic (17β-estradiol equivalents) activity using the A-SCREEN and E-SCREEN bioassays and b) concentrations of anabolic agents via gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy and enzyme-based immunoassays. Water samples were collected over 3 years from up to six sites [all confluent with the Elkhorn River, Nebraska, USA: a feedlot retention pond (site 1), a site downstream from site 1 (site 2), a stream with intermediate livestock impact (site 3), and three sites with no observable livestock impact (sites 4-6)] and two sources of tap water. In 1999, samples from site 1 contained 9.6 pM R1881 equivalents and 1.7 pM 17β-estradiol equivalents. Site 2 samples had estrogen levels similar to those in site 1 samples but lower androgen levels (3.8 pM R1881 equivalents). Androgen levels in site 3 samples were similar to those in site 2 samples, whereas estrogen levels decreased to 0.7 pM 17β-estradiol equivalents. At site 6, androgen levels were approximately half those found at site 3, and estrogen levels were comparable with those at site 3. Sampling in later years was limited to fewer sites because of drought and lack of permission to access one site. Instrumental analysis revealed estrone but no significant levels of resorcylic acid lactones or trenbolone metabolites. Tap water was devoid of hormonal activity. We conclude that feedlot effluents contain sufficient levels of hormonally active agents to warrant further investigation of possible effects on aquatic ecosystem health.},

abstract={Somatotropins, which are used in cattle for growth and lactating performances, are difficult to reliably detect because no direct method exists. Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HLC) coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupole mass spectrometry (ESI(+)-MS) has been developed to separate and characterize the N-terminal peptides resulting from tryptic cleavage of natural and recombinant growth hormones from different species (bovine, porcine, and human) and suppliers. Conditions for tryptic digestion were optimized. This technique was found to be optimal to cleave efficiently the N-terminal peptide of the proteins without releasing too much noise from the matrix. Characterization of the peptides through ESI(+)-MS allowed natural and recombinant growth hormones from bovine and porcine species with N-terminal amino acid sequences differing from one amino acid residue to be discriminated. However, the studied human growth hormones had similar primary sequences that did not permit any discrimination between recombinant and natural forms, thus confirming the known identity of these hormones. Protein digestions with pepsin and chymotrypsin were also compared but were not conclusive due to the too small N-terminal peptides released after proteolysis.},

abstract={Among the organic persistant pollutant (POP), the dioxines and PCB dioxine like present a large toxicity for humans and environment. A calculation of the toxicity equivalent concentration (TEQ) of each sample is made using international consensus toxicity equivalence factors (TEFs) and the TEQ is use to determine if the concentrations of target compounds in the sample are below the limit guide value of 0.1ng I.TEQ/Nm3 for the emissions and 3 pg/g of fat in milk samples. The reference method for the determination of polychlorodibenzo-p- dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDF) at very low concentration is high resolution gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). These instruments are very expensive to purchase and maintain. The alternatives are to use the more economic quadripole ion trap or simple quadrupole mass spectrometers. The aim of this study is to establish a method which delivers comparable results by using a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an external ionization source. The advantages of this method, in comparison to single quadrupole instruments, are the increase in sensitivity and the greater selectivity obtained by the use of tandem mass spectrometry (MSn). Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) involves a typical four step process, which are the ionisation (EI), parent ion isolation, collision induced dissociation (CID) and mass analysis of the daughter ions. The development is based on the determination of those conditions for the compounds of interest (PCDD/F and PCB dioxin-like). The MS/MS method was then used to analyse PCDD/F and PCB dioxin-like in an extract of fly ash from a Municipal Solid Waste Incinerator and compared with the results obtained by HRMS. The total TEQ concentration of PCDD/F is 939 pg TEQ/g with the MS/MS method and 723 pg TEQ/g with the conventional method. Same results are obtained for the PCB dioxin-like which are respectively 37 pg TEQ/g by MS/MS and 21 pg TEQ/g by HRMS. Those promising results were confirmed with the participation of an worldwide intercalibration study in which ous results were similar to those obtained by the other laboratory. For example, the value obtained by our laboratory is 2,59 ng TEQ/g instead of the mediane value of 2,21 ng TEQ/g. The differences between MS/MS and HRMS are in accordance with the 100% deviation of the analysis of emission samples presented in the european guideline EN 1948.},

abstract={In an international context of promoting scientific research on food safety, the interest in molecules having potential hormonal disrupting effects is growing. While industrial endocrine disruptors (phthalates, alkylphenols, PCBs, etc.) have been studied for several years, natural compounds like phytoestrogens remain less investigated. Accordingly, a research project was initiated with its main objectives to develop efficient analytical methods for a wide range of phytoestrogens in various food matrices, and to evaluate their occurrence in food products. Electrospray ionization with tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis of isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, equol, formononetin, biochanin A), lignans (enterolactone, enterodiol), and coumestans (coumestrol) was investigated. This study revealed the formation of a large number of fragment ions in both positive and negative modes, corresponding to specific cleavages of the hydroxyl, carbonyl, and/or methoxy groups, and to Retro-Diels-Alder reactions. An LC/ESI-MS/MS method was developed consistent with the 2002/657/EC European decision criteria. An extraction and clean-up method was developed for milk samples. The identification limit for the proposed method appears to be under 1 ng/mL. The developed methodology was applied to various milk samples, and the occurrence of isoflavones (particularly equol) was demonstrated in the concentration range 1-30 ng/mL. The efficiency of the proposed analytical method permitted evaluation of a new and promising approach to a global risk assessment of natural estrogenic active substances including phytoestrogens and their metabolites.

abstract={The role of the host in the nitrogen nutrition of Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. (Scrophulariaceae) parasitic on Sorghum bicolor cv. SH4 Arval has been investigated using 15N-nitrate as the tracer. It is shown that, when nitrate is absorbed only by the roots of the host plant, a rapid transfer of nitrogen to the parasite can be detected. The xylem sap of S. hermonthica contained approximately equal amounts of nitrate and amino acids, mostly glutamine and asparagine. Infection altered the free amino acid profile of the host tissues, leading notably to a large increase in asparagine and a decrease in glutamine. The haustoria of S. hermonthica, although rich in nitrate, showed a low concentration of free amino acids, particularly lacking in asparagine and glutamine. The roots of S. hermonthica, in contrast, were rich in both asparagine and glutamine while, in the shoots, asparagine constituted 80% of the total FAA pool. Asparagine was also found to be the primary 15N-enriched amino acid in the shoots of S. hermonthica while, interestingly, it was glutamate that was most strongly enriched in the roots. It is concluded that nitrogen nutrition in S. hermonthica is based on a supply of both nitrate and amino acids from the host. This implies a non-specific transfer in the transpiration stream. Nitrate reduction probably occurs mainly in the leaves of the parasite. Assimilation also occurs in S. hermonthica and excess nitrogen is stored as the non-toxic nitrogen-rich compound, asparagine. This specific trait of nitrogen metabolism of the parasite is discussed in relation to the effect of nitrogen fertilization on reducing infestation.},

abstract={Ecdysteroids, polyhydroxylated Δ7-8-6-ketosteroids, are widespread in plants and invertebrates, especially arthropods. As early as the 1960s, several studies underlined the potential of ecdysterone to enhance the rate of protein synthesis in mammalian tissue. For these suspected anabolic properties, ecdysteroids such as ecdysone or ajugasterone, are widely diffused on the Internet and are presented as powerful growth promoters without any hormonal consequences. Because these compounds would be potentially used as anabolizing agents in food producing animals, it was necessary to develop an efficient analytical method dedicated to their analysis in biological matrices gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was compared to liquid chromatography (LC)-MS for this purpose. Ecdysteroids, because of their numerous alcohol functions produced, after derivatisation, various by-products, making the GC-MS interpretation difficult. LC-MS was more appropriate, especially when positive electrospray ionization (ESI) and MS/MS acquisition were used; detection and identification (4 MRM transitions) limits were determined in the pg range. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={During the last few years, control within the European Union (EU) for illegal growth promoters in cattle and pigs revealed only a limited number of positives. Analysis of illegal preparations, however, showed that steroids, often (esters of) natural hormones, and β-agonists are still used. Corticosteroids, controlled to a much lesser extent, seem to have become the most important group, while even thyreostats remain. Alarming information was obtained from specific investigations in which a large variety of products were found, some of which had never been reported to be misused in the field of growth promotion. For β-agonists and quinoxaline compounds, analogues of known compounds are synthesised. Other compounds are readily available as they are registered as growth promoters in some countries outside Europe or are allowed for specific veterinary purposes. Some classes of veterinary drugs are misused for their secondary pharmacological effects, e.g. benzodiazepines as feed intake enhancers and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as pale meat-making agents. Several non-traditional substances are suspected to be used in the field of breeding animals. This is the case for growth hormones (GHs) and all substances acting over this anabolic compound, as for instance, orally GH secretagogue. Moreover, ecdysteroids, which according to old Russian studies, have anabolic activity, are actually very easy to purchase on the Internet. Recent findings in different classes of growth promoters are discussed in detail. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A liquid chromatography combined to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to confirm the presence of 11 synthetic glucocorticoids in cattle liver is described. After an enzymatic deconjugation step, liver samples were treated with methanol to extract the glucocorticoids. A further cleanup of the extracts was carried out by SPE. LC separations were carried out as described previously using a column packed with porous graphitic carbon. For the detection positive (ESI+) and negative (ESI-) electrospray ionization were evaluated, but the preference was given to the negative mode for most of the analytes. The complete method was validated according to SANCO/1085/2000, giving decision limits and detection capabilities in 0.08-0.38μgkg-1 range for the banned glucocorticoids and between 0.1 and 0.5μgkg-1 above the established maximum residue limits (MRLs) values for betamethasone, dexamethasone, prednisolone and methylprednisolone. Several incurred liver samples of animals treated with different glucocorticoids were analyzed. In order to obtain a maximum amount of unconjugated parent drug, enzymatic hydrolysis conditions were optimized using liver samples of a calf treated simultaneously with beta- and dexamethasone. A central composite experimental design was applied and the estimated response surface plots were used to select optimal conditions of pH, temperature and duration of the preliminary deconjugation step. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Pyrolysis coupled to metastable atom bombardment (MAB) and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) is used for generating mass spectra from bovine urine samples obtained from cattle treated with anabolic steroids. These spectra constitute fingerprints, which can be discriminated by multivariate statistical analysis. Four main conclusions can be drawn from this work: (i) The use of different metastable gases, such as Xe*, Kr*, or N2*, as an energy-tunable ionization beamline allows control of the internal energy and the dissociation processes of the produced odd electron molecular ions, thus giving rise to complementary mass spectra fingerprints. (ii) A variable transformation depending on the biofluid matrix suitably contracts the frequency distribution of the generated data for low m/z ratios holding information related to endogenous metabolites encountered in urine. (iii) Coupling variable selection to statistical pattern recognition methods results in low error rates (&lt;1%) for predicting MAB mass fingerprints, especially using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). (iv) LDA discriminates controls from treated animals and also correlates to quantitative physiological responses induced by anabolic steroids. This work shows that Py-MAB-TOFMS could be a suitable method for complementary monitoring anabolic use in sports, medicine, and cattle breeding, as well as monitoring many other long-lasting although weak physiological disruptions.},

abstract={Corticosteroid compounds are widely used therapeutically for their anti-inflammatory properties and sometimes as growth promoters in food producing animals. In the field of drug residue analysis, knowledge of the main metabolic pathways of target analytes improves the efficiency of the corresponding control. Thus, phase II metabolism of corticosteroids, for which very little literature is available, was investigated in cattle. An LC-MS/MS detection method was developed for five commercially available conjugated corticosteroids, permitting direct monitoring during the development of their separation on anion exchange SPE. This separation method is further applicable to other potential urinary conjugated corticosteroids. Because our purpose was not to identify all the existing corticosteroid phase II metabolites, but to obtain their total relative proportions, enzymatic hydrolysis was optimized and performed on each separated fraction (glucuronides and sulfates). Finally, the phase II metabolic profiles of natural and artificial corticosteroids in bovine urine were studied and compared. LC-MS/MS detection with negative electrospray ionization appeared efficient for both glucuronide and sulfate conjugated corticosteroids, and quaternary ammonium stationary phase permitted their effective separation. The experimental design used for optimization of the enzymatic hydrolysis with a purified Helix pomatia preparation demonstrated optimal values for pH 5.2, temperature of 50°C and incubation duration of 4h. Results on bovine urine samples collected on two animals before and after dexamethasone administration showed important differences regarding the proportion of total conjugated forms between endogenous cortisol, endogenous tetrahydrocortisol, and exogenous dexamethasone. This proportion appeared significantly higher for tetrahydrocortisol (40-65%) than cortisol (2-8%) or dexamethasone (4-27%). This innovative methodology demonstrates the suitability of anion exchange SPE and LC-MS/MS for the study of steroid hormones phase II metabolism, and appears promising to investigate metabolic profile differences linked to the hormone administration mode or origin, with direct application in the field of doping controls. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract={Metabonomic characterization of long-lasting although weak physiological events such as anabolic disruptions remains poorly investigated. We have validated 1H-13C HMBC-NMR as a suitable generator of instrumental variables that are strongly linked to the concentration of endogenous metabolites in biological fluids. This method is interfaced to multivariate pattern recognition procedures. Fingerprints established from urine sample collected on cattle treated with anabolic steroids were used to validate this method. Four main results arise from this study. (i) 2D NMR is as informative as 1D NMR. (ii) 2D NMR variable clustering highlights successfully a contingent redundancy of variables, although a relevant hierarchical model of statistical correlations covering from structural relationships to physiologic links can also be evidenced. (iii) To enhance pattern recognition performances, we have validated a variable selection algorithm for accurate prediction of unknown individuals belonging to predetermined groups achieved by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This algorithm synthesizes the whole information contained in the data set by selecting preferentially nonredundant variables. Parameters generating variable subsets are validated by predicted variance efficiency obtained when minimizing error rates calculated by cross-validation methods. (iv) Provided variables are correctly filtered, LDA fairly competes with partial least-squares methods for both classification of individuals and statistical interpretation of metabolic responses obtained in such a physiological disruption context.},

abstract={When administered to human subjects, nandrolone is metabolized into two main products, 19-norandrosterone (19-NA) and 19-noretiocholanolone (19-NE). Recent studies demonstrated the endogenous production of these compounds in man at concentrations very close to the threshold of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), i.e. 2 ng/ml. Because the possibility of reaching or exceeding this fateful limit is difficult to exclude, a complementary biochemical parameter is necessary for the differentiation of endogenous 19-NA and 19-NE production from residues resulting from nandrolone consumption. We measured the endogenous concentrations of 19-NA and 19-NE in 385 urine samples from professional football players, and we studied the phase II metabolite composition in individuals excreting the highest concentrations. The results showed that around 30% of endogenous 19-norandrosterone was sulfo-conjugated, whereas 100% of 19-norandrosterone was excreted conjugated to a glucuronic acid when nandrolone was administered. This significant qualitative difference appears to be a promising complementary criterion to more definitively conclude about an athlete's culpability, especially when nandrolone metabolites are found in the low ng/ml range. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract={19-Norandrosterone (19-NA) and 19-noretiocholanolone (19-NE) are the two main indicators used to prove the illegal use of nandrolone by humans. Recent studies showed that 19-NA and 19-NE can be endogenously produced in some individuals. The mediated cases observed over the last three years generated some questions about the appropriateness of the official International Olympic Committee cutoff level, which is 2 ng/mL of 19-NA in male urine samples. In the present study, professional soccer players belonging to the French First League were studied over a period of 19 months. In total, 385 urine samples were taken immediately before and after soccer competitions and were coupled with 200 blood samples for testosterone and LH determination. Results of the study showed that the mean values for 19-NA and 19-NE were 0.097 ng/mL and 0.033 ng/mL, respectively. For 19-NA, 70% of the samples proved to be below 0.1 ng/mL, whereas less than 20% were found to be between 0.1 and 0.2 ng/mL, and 7% were between 0.2 and 0.3 ng/mL. Only four urine samples were above 1.0 ng/mL; the maximal value was 1.79 ng/mL. For 19-NE, only one sample was above 1.0 ng/mL; the value was 1.42 ng/mL. Concentrations of these compounds after games were generally significantly higher than those before games.},

abstract={A new derivatisation reaction applied to the analysis of steroids by gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS) was studied. The trimethylsilylated steroids were characterised by well-resolved chromatographic signals, no peak tailing, reproducible 13C/12C measurements (0.32‰, n = 28), good signal-to-noise ratio and absolute intensity (5 × 10-9 A, 20 ng), and a slow degradation of copper oxide pellets in the combustion furnace. In addition, two new metabolites and one precursor of testosterone in bovine have been brought into consideration and used for GC/C/IRMS measurements, namely, 3β-hydroxy-5α-androstan-17-one (epiandrosterone), 3β,17α-dihydroxy-5α-androstene, and 3β,17α-dihydroxy-5-androstene. The new findings have been applied to an elimination study in bovine of testosterone metabolites after an intramuscular injection of testosterone enanthate. Significant differences (up to 4‰) between testosterone metabolites and precursor were detectable at least three weeks after administration. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={In previous work (Le Bizec et al., Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2000;14:1058), it was demonstrated that a boar meal intake could lead to possible false accusations of abuse of 17β-nortestosterone in antidoping control. The aim of the present study was to identify and quantify endogenous 19-norsteroids in boar edible tissue at concentrations that can alter the steroid urinary profile in humans, and lead to excretion of 19-norandrosterone (19-NA) and 19-noretiocholanolone (19-NE). The samples were analysed in two laboratories. The methodologies used for extraction and detection (GC/MS(EI) and LC/MS/MS(APCI+)) are compared and discussed. 19-Norandrostenedione (NAED), 17β- and 17α-nortestosterone (bNT, aNT), and 17β- and 17α-testosterone (bT, aT) were quantified. The largest concentrations of NAED and bNT were observed in testicles (83 and 172 μg/kg), liver (17 and 63 μg/kg) and kidney (45 and 38 μg/kg). A correlation between the bNT and NAED content of a typical meal prepared with boar parts and the excreted concentrations of 19-NA and 19-NE in human urine was demonstrated.
