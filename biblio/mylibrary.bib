	abstract = {In an effort to develop local productions of aromatic and medicinal plants, a comprehensive assessment of the composition and biological activities of the essential oils ({EOs}) extracted from the aerial flowering parts of wild growing Lavandula stoechas L. collected from eleven different locations in northern Algeria was performed. The oils were characterized by {GC}-{FID} and {GC}/{MS} analyses, and 121 compounds were identified, accounting for 69.88–91.2\% of the total oil compositions. The eleven oils greatly differed in their compositions, since only 66 compounds were common to all oils. Major {EO} components were fenchone (2; 11.27–37.48\%), camphor (3, 1.94–21.8\%), 1,8-cineole (1; 0.16–8.71\%), and viridiflorol (10; 2.89–7.38\%). The assessed in vitro biological properties demonstrated that the {DPPH}-based radical-scavenging activities and the inhibition of the β-carotene/linoleic acid-based lipid oxidation differed by an eight-fold factor between the most and the least active oils and were linked to different sets of molecules in the different {EOs}. The eleven {EOs} exhibited good antimicrobial activities against most of the 16 tested strains of bacteria, filamentous fungi, and yeasts, with minimum inhibitory concentrations ({MICs}) ranging from 0.16 to 11.90 mg/ml.},

	abstract = {Summary: {MSeasy} performs unsupervised data mining on gas chromatography–mass spectrometry data. It detects putative compounds within complex metabolic mixtures through the clustering of mass spectra. Retention times or retention indices are used after clustering, together with other validation criteria, for quality control of putative compounds. The package generates a fingerprinting or profiling matrix compatible with {NIST} mass spectral search program and {ARISTO} webtool (Automatic Reduction of Ion Spectra To Ontology) for molecule identification. Most commonly used file formats, {NetCDF}, {mzXML} and {ASCII}, are acceptable. A graphical and user-friendly interface, {MSeasyTkGUI}, is available for R novices.
Availability: {MSeasy} and {MSeasytkGUI} are implemented as R packages available at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/{MSeasy}/index.html and http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/{MSeasyTkGUI}/index.html

	abstract = {Pinnatoxin G ({PnTX}-G) is a marine toxin belonging to the class of cyclic imines and produced by the dinoflagellate Vulcanodinium rugosum. In spite of its strong toxicity to mice, leading to the classification of pinnatoxins into the class of “fast-acting toxins”, its hazard for human health has never been demonstrated. In this study, crude extracts of  V. rugosum exhibited significant cytotoxicity against Neuro2A and {KB} cells. {IC}50 values of 0.38 µg {mL}−1 and 0.19 µg {mL}−1 were estimated on Neuro2A cells after only 24 h of incubation and on {KB} cells after 72 h of incubation, respectively. In the case of Caco-2 cells 48 h after exposure, the crude extract of V. rugosum induced cell cycle arrest accompanied by a dramatic increase in double strand {DNA} breaks, although only 40\% cytotoxicity was observed at the highest concentration tested (5 µg {mL}−1). However, {PnTX}-G was not a potent cytotoxic compound as no reduction of the cell viability was observed on the different cell lines. Moreover, no effects on the cell cycle or {DNA} damage were observed following treatment of undifferentiated Caco-2 cells with {PnTX}-G. The crude extract of V. rugosum was thus partially purified using liquid-liquid partitioning and {SPE} clean-up. In vitro assays revealed strong activity of some fractions containing no {PnTX}-G. The crude extract and the most potent fraction were evaluated using full scan  and tandem high resolution mass spectrometry. The dereplication revealed the presence of  a major compound that could be putatively annotated as nakijiquinone A,  N-carboxy-methyl-smenospongine or stachybotrin A, using the {MarinLit}™ database. Further investigations will be necessary to confirm the identity of the compounds responsible for the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the extracts of V. rugosum.},

An untargeted time-scale metabolomic study has been performed on two different marine-derived Penicillium strains. They were cultivated for 18 days and their crude extracts were analyzed by {HPLC}-{DAD}-{HRMS} (High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Diode Array Detector-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry) each day. With the example of griseofulvin biosynthesis, a pathway shared by both strains, this work provides a new approach to study biosynthetic pathway regulations, which could be applied to other metabolites and more particularly new ones. Moreover, the results of this study emphasize the interest of such an approach for the discovery of new chemical entities. In particular, at every harvesting time, previously undetected features were observed in the {LC}-{MS} (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) data. Therefore, harvesting times for metabolite extraction should be performed at different time points to access the hidden metabolome.},

	abstract = {Mammea coumarins are isoprenylated 4-alkyl or 4-phenylcoumarins. Their distribution is limited to 3 Clusiaceae/Calophyllaceae genera. We recently reported on their presence in Mammea neurophylla bark extracts, where they exhibited anti-{AGE} properties associated with a prevention of the endothelial dysfunction. About 120 mammea coumarins were already described so, in order to focus further phytochemical analysis on original or bio-active compounds, we developed a methodology to facilitate the detection and identification of compounds of interest. Our aim was to develop a {LC}-{DAD}–{ESI}-{MSn} method for rapid, sensitive and simple analysis of the mammea coumarins in calophyllaceous/clusiaceous species. For that, full {LC}-{DAD}–{MSn} data were acquired from 11 4-phenylcoumarins previously isolated in our laboratory. Bark, leaves and fruits of M. neurophylla were then extracted with {DCM} using an {ASE} apparatus. Extracts were finally analyzed through {LC}-{DAD}–{HRMSn} and {UV} and {MS} profiles were compared to our database as well as literature data. Detected new compounds were isolated and their structures elucidated through 1H, 13C and 2D {NMR} analysis. Finally, 24 known mammea coumarins were dereplicated from bark, leaf and fruit {DCM} extracts of M. neurophylla and the structure of 4 unreported compounds could be predicted. In particular, the structures of mammea A/{AA} 9-{hydroxyCycloF} and mammea A/{AB} 9-{hydroxyCycloF} were confirmed after purification and extensive {NMR} analyses. By comparison of {UV} and mass fragmentation data from a small library of reference compounds, {LC}-{DAD}–{HRMSn} analysis of mammea coumarins in crude extracts allows the structure prediction of novel or bio-active compounds. This useful guiding-tool could be easily applied to other Clusiaceae/Calophyllaceae phytochemical analysis.},

	abstract = {{IntroductionRactopamine}, a β-agonist used as growth promoter in livestock, is with great controversy, and it has been forbidden in most countries worldwide. However, due to economic benefits, the possibility of widespread abuse of ractopamine still exists. “Omics” strategies, based on the observation of physiological perturbations, are promising approaches to tackle drug misuse in breeding animals.{ObjectivesA} study was performed to determine if serum-metabolomics could be used to establish a predictive tool for identifying ractopamine misuse in pigs.{MethodsOur} aim was to set up a high performance liquid chromatography—high resolution mass spectrometry based metabolomics workflow for screening pig serum for ractopamine administration. Therefore, an untargeted metabolomics approach was developed to characterize and compare serum metabolic profiles from control and treated pigs. Two different extraction strategies were investigated, and the results showed that the combination of methanol extraction and methanol–water extraction protocols significantly improve the metabolites coverage. A two-level data analysis using univariate and multivariate statistical analyses was carried out to establish descriptive and predictive models.{ResultsThe} discrimination of treated animals from control animals could be achieved. A number of candidate biomarkers that contributed the most in the observed discrimination could be listed.{ConclusionThis} research indicates that metabolomics approach can be considered as a powerful strategy to highlight biomarkers related to ractopamine treatment in pig which may subsequently be implemented as screening strategy to predict for such illicit practices.},

	abstract = {Automated annotation of data, originating from liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry profiles ({LC}–{HRMS}), remains a highly challenging task. Therefore, the Critical Assessment of Small Molecule Identification ({CASMI}) Contest (http://casmi-contest.org/) represents a unique opportunity to blindly evaluate annotation workflows. The 2016 {CASMI} contest consisted of 16 {LC}–{HRMS}/{MS} profiles with 18 detected peaks to annotate. Those peaks corresponded to compounds from natural origin. An R script based on the {XCMS}, {IPO}, {RMassBank}, {CAMERA} and {MeHaloCoA} packages was devised. Two other external tools: {SIRIUS}3 and {CFM}-{ID} were also integrated for molecular formulae and in silico fragmentation calculation, respectively. This script was used to perform peak picking, spectral interpretation, molecular formula determination and database search for structural determination. Finally, the structures were further discriminated based on in silico fragmentation. After the release of the {CASMI} contest solutions, successes and failures of the proposed script were investigated. In most cases, no differences were observed in the rank of the correct structure when using raw {LC}–{HRMS} data or manually obtained {MS} and {MS}/{MS} spectra. However, the study of the few cases where differences were detected tends to show that automatic detection of {MS}2 data within the raw {LC}–{MS} data yielded more accurate identification. The failures in proposing the correct structure within the submission list were related to the absence of the right structure in the interrogated databases. However, very close structure were proposed in first rank indicating that such approaches are able to rapidly determine the carbon skeleton of the structure; the medium rank of the correct structure in the proposed list for each peak of interest being 2nd.},
