	abstract = {In recent years, the commercialization of hybrid ion mobility-mass spectrometers and their integration in traditional {LC}-{MS} workﬂows provide new opportunities to extend the current boundaries of targeted and non-targeted analyses. When coupled to {LC}-{MS}, ion mobility spectrometry ({IMS}) provides a novel characterization parameter, the so-called averaged collision cross section ({CCS}, U), as well as improves method selectivity and sensitivity by the separation of isobaric and isomeric molecules and the isolation of the analytes of interest from background noise. In this work, we have explored the potential and advantages of this technology for carrying out the determination of phase {II} steroid metabolites (i.e. androgen and estrogen conjugates, including glucuronide and sulfate compounds; n ¼ 25) in urine samples. These molecules have been selected based on their relevance in the ﬁelds of chemical food safety and doping control, as well as in metabolomics studies. The inﬂuence of urine matrix on the {CCS} of steroid metabolites was evaluated in order to give more conﬁdence to current {CCS} databases and support its use as complementary information to retention time (Rt) and mass spectra for compound identiﬁcation. Samples were only diluted 10-fold with aqueous formic acid (0.1\%, v/v) prior analysis. Only an almost insigniﬁcant effect of adult bovine urine matrix on the {CCS} of certain steroid metabolites was observed in comparison with calve urine matrix, which is a less complex sample. In addition, high accuracy was achieved for {CCS} measurements carried out over four months ({DCCS} {\textless} 1.3\% for 99.8\% of {CCS} measurements; n ¼ 1806). Interestingly, it has been observed that signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio could be improved at least 2 or 7-fold when {IMS} is combined with {LC}-{MS}. In addition to the separation of isomeric steroid pairs (i.e. etiocholanolone glucuronide and epiandrosterone glucuronide, as well as 19noretiocholanolone glucuronide and 19-norandrosterone glucuronide), steroid-based ions were also separated in the {IMS} dimension from co-eluting matrix compounds that presented similar mass-tocharge ratio (m/z). Finally, based on {CCS} measurements and as a proof of concept, 17a-boldenone glucuronide has been identiﬁed as one of the main metabolites resulted from boldione administration to calves.},

A threshold relying on the 15N/14N was established to diﬀerentiate between hair and feathers; a value below 6.6‰ indicates a poultry feathers origin.

The aim of our work was to provide a unique method able to quantify the widest range of {BFRs} in feed and food items. After freezedrying and grinding, a pressurized liquid extraction was carried out. The extract was puriﬁed on acidiﬁed silica, Florisil® and carbon columns, the four separated fractions were analyzed by gas and liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution and tandem mass spectrometry. Isotopic dilution was preferentially used when commercial labelled compounds were available. Analytical sensitivity was in accordance with the expectations of Recommendation 2014/118/{EU} for {PBDEs}, {HBCDDs}, {TBBPA}, {TBBPAbME}, {EHTBB}, {BEHTEBP} and {TBBPA}-{bME}. Additional {BFRs} were included in this analytical method with the same level of performances ({LOQs} below 0.01 ng {gÀ}1 ww). These are {PBBs}, {pTBX}, {TBCT}, {PBBz}, {PBT}, {PBEB}, {HBBz}, {BTBPE}, {OBIND} and T23BPIC.

In particular, {DRCs} have been detected in various environmental matrices and in different aquatic and terrestrial biota, thus exhibiting bioaccumulation and biomagniﬁcation potentials. The present study aimed at producing ﬁrst occurrence data of a range of {DRCs} in Silurus spp. samples from different rivers located in France. Determination was carried out by gas chromatography highresolution mass spectrometry after a sample clean-up based on a multilayer silica column and gel permeation chromatography. The concentration of monitored {SDRCs} ranged from 1.58 to 408 pg {gÀ}1 wet weight (54e11100 pg {gÀ}1 lipid weight). The fractional abundance of syn- and anti-{DP} stereoisomers was similar to that reported by other studies with an average equal to 0.60. Dec-601 was not detected in any sample. Detection frequencies ranged between 34 and 100\% for other {DRCs}.

Therefore, the Critical Assessment of Small Molecule Identiﬁcation ({CASMI}) Contest (http://casmi-contest.org/) represents a unique opportunity to blindly evaluate annotation workﬂows. The 2016 {CASMI} contest consisted of 16 {LC}–{HRMS}/ {MS} proﬁles with 18 detected peaks to annotate. Those peaks corresponded to compounds from natural origin. An R script based on the {XCMS}, {IPO}, {RMassBank}, {CAMERA} and {MeHaloCoA} packages was devised. Two other external tools: {SIRIUS}3 and {CFM}-{ID} were also integrated for molecular formulae and in silico fragmentation calculation, respectively. This script was used to perform peak picking, spectral interpretation, molecular formula determination and database search for structural determination. Finally, the structures were further discriminated based on in silico fragmentation. After the release of the {CASMI} contest solutions, successes and failures of the proposed script were investigated. In most cases, no differences were observed in the rank of the correct structure when using raw {LC}–{HRMS} data or manually obtained {MS} and {MS}/{MS} spectra. However, the study of the few cases where differences were detected tends to show that automatic detection of {MS}2 data within the raw {LC}–{MS} data yielded more accurate identiﬁcation. The failures in proposing the correct structure within the submission list were related to the absence of the right structure in the interrogated databases. However, very close structure were proposed in ﬁrst rank indicating that such approaches are able to rapidly determine the carbon skeleton of the structure; the medium rank of the correct structure in the proposed list for each peak of interest being 2nd.},

While haustorium development is initiated upon chemodetection of host-derived molecules in hemiparasitic plants, the induction of haustorium formation remains largely unknown in holoparasitic species such as Phelipanche ramosa. This work demonstrates that the root exudates of the host plant Brassica napus contain allelochemicals displaying haustorium-inducing activity on P. ramosa germinating seeds, which increases the parasite aggressiveness. A de novo assembled transcriptome and microarray approach with P. ramosa during early haustorium formation upon treatment with B. napus root exudates allowed the identification of differentially expressed genes involved in hormone signaling. Bioassays using exogenous cytokinins and the specific cytokinin receptor inhibitor {PI}-55 showed that cytokinins induced haustorium formation and increased parasite aggressiveness. Root exudates triggered the expression of cytokinin-responsive genes during early haustorium development in germinated seeds, and bio-guided {UPLC}-{ESI}(+)-/{MS}/{MS} analysis showed that these exudates contain a cytokinin with dihydrozeatin characteristics. These results suggest that cytokinins constitutively exudated from host roots play a major role in haustorium formation and aggressiveness in P. ramosa.},

	abstract = {Twenty-one sediment samples were taken from ﬁve dated sediment cores collected along the Rhône River from 2008 to 2011. A total of 17 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ({PCDD}/Fs), 7 polychlorinated biphenyls ({PCBs}), 8 polybrominated diphenyl ethers ({PBDEs}), 3 polybrominated biphenyls ({PBBs}), 3 hexabromocyclododecanes ({HBCD}) and 31 organochlorine pesticides ({OCPs}) were investigated to provide information on deposition dynamics in time and space, but also regarding the ecotoxicological risks associated with these contaminants. Median concentrations of total {PBDEs} are nine times lower than the levels of total {PCBs} along the entire studied stretch of the Rhône River. The results show that total {PBDEs} concentrations range from 0.06 to 239 μg·kg−1 {DW} with a median value of 3.81 μg·kg−1 {DW} and a maximum concentration measured in the years 2000s. These maximum concentrations are identical to those measured for total {PCBs} at the end of the 1990s, but show a different pattern of distribution. Abnormal dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ({DDT}) levels were also detected in the downstream section of the river, with a peak concentration of 147.5 μg·kg−1 {DW} measured at the {GEC} site from 2005 onwards. Analyses of the enantiomeric fractions reveal a fresh input resulting from a technical formulation. Sediments from the core sampled at the most downstream site ({GEC}) are found to be highly toxic to organisms living nearby, particularly because of the total {PCDD}/Fs, {DDE} and {DDT} levels. In addition, based on available sediment quality guidelines, there may be a potential bioaccumulation risk for humans not only for these three compounds of concern but also for total {PCBs} and 7 out of the 8 analysed {PBDEs}. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The gold-standard matrix for measuring the internal levels of persistent organic pollutants ({POPs}) is the adipose tissue, however in epidemiological studies the use of serum is preferred due to the low cost and higher accessibility. The interpretation of serum biomarkers is tightly related to the understanding of the underlying causal structure relating the {POPs}, serum lipids and the disease. Considering the extended beneﬁts of using serum biomarkers we aimed to further examine if through statistical modelling we would be able to improve the use and interpretation of serum biomarkers in the study of endometriosis. Hence, we have conducted a systematic comparison of statistical approaches commonly used to lipidadjust the circulating biomarkers of {POPs} based on existing methods, using data from a pilot casecontrol study focused on severe deep inﬁltrating endometriosis. The odds ratios ({ORs}) obtained from unconditional regression for those models with serum biomarkers were further compared to those obtained from adipose tissue. The results of this exploratory study did not support the use of blood biomarkers as proxy estimates of {POPs} in adipose tissue to implement in risk models for endometriosis with the available statistical approaches to correct for lipids. The current statistical approaches commonly used to lipid-adjust circulating {POPs}, do not fully represent the underlying biological complexity between {POPs}, lipids and disease (especially those directly or indirectly affecting or affected by lipid metabolism). Hence, further investigations are warranted to improve the use and interpretation of blood biomarkers under complex scenarios of lipid dynamics.},

Metabolomics in particular has been investigated in the hope of identifying such biomarkers, and a range of studies have demonstrated the efficiency of the strategy. Until very recently, steps remained to be taken towards official or commercial implementation of corresponding tools. In particular, the lack of guidelines and criteria to validate such methods that do not target specific chemical species per se, constituted a bottleneck. In the present work, a metabolomics model dedicated to the detection of β-agonist administration in bovines has been developed and fully validated; criteria (selectivity, robustness, stability, suspicion threshold definition, false positive and false negative rates) have been proposed in agreement with {EU} expectations (Dec 2002/657), enabling demonstration that performances comply with screening requirements.},

	abstract = {The present study investigated the developmental neurotoxicity of an early exposure to α-{HBCDD} through the ingestion of contaminated hen's egg in pregnant and lactating Wistar female rats. Hens were given α-{HBCDDcontaminated} feed (40 ng/g fresh matter) for 5 and 10 days, which produced eggs with {HBCDD} content of 33 and 102 ng/g lipid weight, respectively. Female rats were administered daily p.o. with an appropriate volume of the whole egg from the day of fertilization ({GD}0) to the weaning day for pups ({PND}21). Fetuses and pups were thus exposed continuously to α-{HBCDD} via the dam over a whole 42-day period that included both gestation and lactation. The administered egg volume was calculated on the basis of daily egg consumption in humans (0.7 egg/person/day) and duration of gestation and lactation in both species, which led animals to be exposed to α-{HBCDD} at levels of 22 and 66 ng/kg/day, respectively. Neurobehavioral development of pups was investigated from {PND}3 to {PND}25 using various tasks including the righting reﬂex ({PND}4), the grasping reﬂex ({PND}5), the negative geotaxis ({PND}9), the forelimb grip strength test ({PND}10) and the locomotor coordination test ({PND}20). Pup ultrasonic vocalizations were also recorded daily from {PND}4 to {PND}14. After weaning, behaviors related to spontaneous locomotor activity and anxiety were examined in the open-ﬁeld ({PND}25) and in an elevated-plus maze ({PND}26), respectively. The results showed a signiﬁcant decrease in body weight of pups exposed to the lower {HBCDD} level from {PND}3 to {PND}28, whereas the weight of rat pups given 66 ng/kg/day of {HBCDD} was not different from controls. During the ﬁrst 3 weeks of life, impairments in motor maturation of pups were observed in a dose-dependent manner depending on the test, whereas no signiﬁcant differences were reported between male and female pups. At {PND}26, the anxiety level of female rats exposed to the lowest dose of {HBCDD} (22 ng/kg/day) was signiﬁcantly reduced whereas it remained unchanged in males. No signiﬁcant variations were measured in rats exposed to the higher level of {HBCDD} (66 ng/kg/day). These results suggest the potent developmental neurotoxicity of an early chronic exposure to the {HBCDD} α-isomer through the ingestion of hen's eggs contaminated with this pollutant and question the long-lasting consequences of this exposure on behavior abilities and brain functioning in adulthood.},

	abstract = {One major concern regarding perﬂuoroalkyl acids ({PFAAs}) is their potential role in onset of health troubles consecutive to early exposure during the perinatal period. In the present work, the internal exposure levels of 18 targeted {PFAAs} were determined in ca. 100 mother–newborn pairs recruited in France between 2010 and 2013. In serum, the cumulated concentrations of the 7 most frequently detected compounds were 5.70 ng/{mL} and 2.83 ng/{mL} (median values) in maternal and cord serum, respectively. Perﬂuorooctanesulfonic acid ({PFOS}), perﬂuorooctanoic acid ({PFOA}), perﬂuorohexylesulfonic acid ({PFHxS}) and perﬂuorononanoic acid ({PFNA}) contributed to around 90\% of the total {PFAAs} contamination, with concentration levels and contamination proﬁles in accordance with other published work in Europe. Levels measured in breast milk were far lower (20 to 150 fold) than those determined in serum. Associations between the different monitored substances as well as between levels determined in the different investigated biological matrices mostly do not appear statistically signiﬁcant. The estimated materno-foetal transfer would be thus substance-dependant, mainly driven by the physico-chemical properties of the different {PFAAs} (nature of polar group and length of alkylated side chain). We conclude that trans-placental passage and breastfeeding are both signiﬁcant routes of human exposure to {PFAAs}.},

Lactococcus piscium {CNCM} I-4031 has the capacity to prevent the growth of L. monocytogenes in contaminated peeled and cooked shrimp. To investigate the inhibititory mechanism, a chemically deﬁned medium ({MSMA}) based on shrimp composition and reproducing the inhibition observed in shrimp was developed. In co-culture at 26 C, L. monocytogenes was reduced by 3e4 log {CFU} {gÀ}1 after 24 h. We have demonstrated that the inhibition was not due to secretion of extracellular antimicrobial compounds as bacteriocins, organic acids and hydrogen peroxide. Global metabolomic ﬁngerprints of these strains in pure culture were assessed by liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry. Consumption of glucose, amino-acids, vitamins, nitrogen bases, iron and magnesium was measured and competition for some molecules could be hypothesized. However, after 24 h of co-culture, when inhibition of L. monocytogenes occurred, supplementation of the medium with these compounds did not restore its growth. The inhibition was observed in co-culture but not in diffusion chamber when species were separated by a ﬁlter membrane. Taken together, these data indicate that the inhibition mechanism of L. monocytogenes by L. piscium is cell-to-cell contactdependent.},

The results show that no isomerization of α- to β- or γ-{HBCDD} forms occurred, whereas {OH}-{HBCDD} was identiﬁed as a product of α-{HBCDD} metabolism. Irrespective of the level of feed contamination, estimates of steady-state accumulation ratios were 5.2, 3.6, and 9.2 and half-lives were estimated at 17.4, 22.8, and 35.3 days in egg yolk, liver tissue, and abdominal fat, respectively. The steady-state carry-over rate to eggs was 22.9\%. Thus, α-{HBCDD} ingested by laying hens is readily transferred to eggs and signiﬁcantly accumulates in adipose tissue.},

A ﬁshing strategy was developed based on untargeted proﬁling among full scan acquisition datasets provided by high resolution mass spectrometry. Since large datasets arise from such proﬁling, ﬁltering useful information stands as a central question. In this way, we took advantage of the exact mass differences between Cl and Br isotopes. Indeed, our workﬂow involved an innovative Visual Basic for Applications script aiming at pairing features according to this mass difference, in order to point out potential organohalogenated clusters, preceded by an automated peak picking step based on the {centWave} function (xcms package of open access R programming environment). Then, H/Cl-scale mass defect plots were used to visualize the datasets before and after ﬁltering. The ﬁltering script was successfully applied to a dataset generated upon liquid chromatography coupled to {ESI}(À)-{HRMS} measurement from one eel muscle extract, allowing for realistic manual investigations of ﬁltered clusters. Starting from 9789 initial obtained features, 1994 features were paired in 589 clusters. Hexabromocyclododecane, chlorinated parafﬁn series and various other compounds have been identiﬁed or tentatively identiﬁed, allowing thus broad screening of organohalogenated compounds in this extract. Although realistic, manual review of paired clusters remains time consuming and much effort should be devoted to automation.},

	abstract = {Urine stability during storage is essential in metabolomics to avoid misleading conclusions or erroneous interpretations. Facing the lack of comprehensive studies on urine metabolome stability, the present work performed a follow-up of potential modiﬁcations in urinary chemical proﬁle using {LC}-{HRMS} on the basis of two parameters: the storage temperature (þ4 C, À20 C, À80 C and freeze-dried stored at À80 C) and the storage duration (5e144 days). Both {HILIC} and {RP} chromatographies have been implemented in order to globally monitor the urinary metabolome. Using an original data processing associated to univariate and multivariate data analysis, our study conﬁrms that chemical proﬁles of urine samples stored at þ4 C are very rapidly modiﬁed, as observed for instance for compounds such as:Nacetyl Glycine, Adenosine, 4-Amino benzoic acid, N-Amino diglycine, creatine, glucuronic acid, 3hydroxy-benzoic acid, pyridoxal, L-pyroglutamic acid, shikimic acid, succinic acid, thymidine, trigonelline and valeryl-carnitine, while it also demonstrates that urine samples stored at À20 C exhibit a global stability over a long period with no major modiﬁcations compared to À80 C condition. This study is the ﬁrst to investigate long term stability of urine samples and report potential modiﬁcations in the urinary metabolome, using both targeted approach monitoring individually a large number (n {\textgreater} 200) of urinary metabolites and an untargeted strategy enabling assessing for global impact of storage conditions.},

Median exposure levels observed in French women ({WHO}-{TEQ}2005 {PCDD}/F ¼ 6.1 pg/g l.w., {WHO}-{TEQ}2005 dl-{PCB} ¼ 4.3 pg/g l.w., sum of 6 ndl-{PCB} ¼ 85.2 ng/g l.w., sum of 7 i-{PBDE} ¼ 1.5 ng/g l.w.) appeared overall lower than in Danish and Finnish women for all examined {POPs}, except for a-{HBCD} (2-fold higher level at 0.6 ng/g l.w.). Furthermore, the observed exposure levels of dioxins and {PCBs} were higher in Danish women ({WHO}-{TEQ}2005 {PCDD}/F ¼ 13.2 pg/g l.w., {WHO}-{TEQ}2005 dl-{PCB} ¼ 6.6 pg/g l.w., sum of 6 ndl-{PCB} ¼ 162.8 ng/g l.w.) compared to Finnish women ({WHO}-{TEQ}2005 {PCDD}/F ¼ 9.0 pg/g l.w., {WHOTEQ}2005 dl-{PCB} ¼ 4.6 pg/g l.w., sum of 6 ndl-{PCB} ¼ 104.0 ng/g l.w.), whereas the concentrations of {PBDEs} were similar for Danish and Finnish women (sum of 7 i-{PBDE} ¼ 4.9 and 5.2 ng/g l.w. respectively). The organochlorine ({OC}) pesticide contamination proﬁle, determined in a subset of French samples, was dominated by p,p’-{DDE} (56.6\%), followed by b-{HCH} (14.2\%), {HCB} (9.7\%) and dieldrin (5.2\%), while other compounds were only minor contributors ({\textless}5\%). The three countries appeared to be discriminated by the observed contamination patterns of the {PCDD}/F versus {PCB}, and the 1,2,3,6,7,8-{HxCDD} versus 1,2,3,4,7,8HxCDD ratios, in addition to the relative contributions of speciﬁc congeners to the contamination proﬁle ({PCBs} \#118 and \#156, {PBDEs} \#28, \#47, \#99 and \#153). In conclusion, unique chemical signatures were observed for each country on the basis of some {POP} congeners.

However, their contour in terms of considered exposure markers remains limited. The present study aimed to characterize the internal exposure levels of 78 persistent organic pollutants ({POPs}, including dioxins, polychlorobiphenyls, brominated ﬂame retardants and organochlorine pesticides) in a set of 113 adult French women (45 controls, 68 cases), and to characterize the distribution of these {POPs} within three biological compartments (omental adipose tissue, parietal adipose tissue, and serum). For all targeted substances, the correlation between the concentrations measured in omental versus parietal adipose tissue was found strongly signiﬁcant (p b 0.0001). An equivalence of the measures performed in parietal and omental adipose tissue was moreover observed with median levels of 6.4 vs. 7.4 pg/g l.w. for {WHO}-{TEQ}2005 {PCDD}/F, 4.5 vs. 4.7 pg/g l.w. for {WHO}-{TEQ}2005 dl-{PCB}, 137.1 vs. 147.9 ng/g l.w. for sum of 6 ndl-{PCB}, and 2.1 vs. 2.0 ng/g l.w. for sum of 7 i-{PBDE}, respectively. The same observation was made for individual targeted {OCs} compounds. Signiﬁcant correlations were also observed between these concentrations determined in adipose tissue and those measured in serum for dioxins ({WHO}-{TEQ}2005 {PCDD}/F = 6.1 pg/g l.w), {PCBs} ({WHO}-{TEQ}2005 dl-{PCB} = 3.6 pg/ g l.w., sum of 6 ndl-{PCB} = 81.1 ng/g l.w.), and brominated ﬂame-retardants (sum of 7 i-{PBDE} = 0.9 ng/g l.w.). The circulating versus stored ratio of some exposure markers (Sum {PCDDs}, 1,2,3,6,7,8-{HxCDF}, slightly versus highly chlorinated {PCBs} ratio, {PBDE} 99 and {PBB} 153) was found statistically different for control and case individuals. These extended exposure data from deep inﬁltrating endometriosis patients are the ﬁrst ones available for France and give a new insight about the equilibrium of chemicals between storage and circulating compartments that should be further considered as new marker of exposure in the context of exposure-health relationship studies.},

The developed analytical method has decreased the run time by three compared to conventional strategies, using a 2.5 m column length (5\% phenyl stationary phase, 0.1 mm i.d., 0.1 ␮m f.t.), a pulsed split injection (1:5) with carrier gas helium ﬂow rate at 0.48 {mL} min−1 in one run of 20 min. For most {BFRs}, analytical data were compared with the current analytical strategy relying on {GC}/{EI}/{HRMS} (double sector, R = 10000 at 10\% valley). Performances in terms of sensitivity were found to meet the Commission recommendation (118/2014/{EC}) for {nBFRs}. {GC}/{APCI}/{MS}/{MS} represents a promising alternative for multi-{BFRs} analysis in complex matrices, in that it allows the monitoring of a wider list of contaminants in a single injection and a shorter run time.},

	abstract = {Selective androgen receptor modulators ({SARMs}) are a novel class of androgen receptor ligands. They are intended to exhibit the same kind of effects as androgenic drugs, like anabolic steroids, but be much more selective in their action, targeting particular tissues without any undesirable effects on others. While the main applications of these synthetic substances are for therapeutic purposes, they also have a high potential for misuse in veterinary practice and the sporting world. In order to guarantee for consumers with food from animal origin that it is free from any residues of such compounds, analytical strategies are required to ensure safe food and also to enable fair trade between producers. In this context an animal experiment involving bovines administered with enobosarm was conducted to provide the study with biological matrices. Different animal matrices (urine and faeces) were investigated to select the most appropriate matrix for use for control purposes, in terms of metabolite relevance and detection time window. Based on ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography ({UHPLC}) with tandem mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}/{MS}) this work highlighted the presence of sulfonated and glucuronated-conjugated forms of the molecule in the urine of treated animals. Enobosarm could be detected in urine up to 9 days after the administration when samples underwent phase {II} hydrolysis. Faeces was demonstrated to be the main matrix of excretion of enobosarm since values up to 500 times higher compared with urine could be detected for 21 days. There was no difference between the kinetic profiles when a deconjugation step was or was not was applied.},

An untargeted time-scale metabolomic study has been performed on two different marine-derived Penicillium strains. They were cultivated for 18 days and their crude extracts were analyzed by {HPLC}-{DAD}-{HRMS} (High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Diode Array Detector-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry) each day. With the example of griseofulvin biosynthesis, a pathway shared by both strains, this work provides a new approach to study biosynthetic pathway regulations, which could be applied to other metabolites and more particularly new ones. Moreover, the results of this study emphasize the interest of such an approach for the discovery of new chemical entities. In particular, at every harvesting time, previously undetected features were observed in the {LC}-{MS} (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) data. Therefore, harvesting times for metabolite extraction should be performed at different time points to access the hidden metabolome.},

Depuration parameters were assessed in {SG} broilers successively exposed during 42 days and depurated during 42 days. At market age, {SG} broilers had ingested 42\% more feed than {FG} broilers, while their body weight gain per g of feed ingested was 34\% lower. No isomerization of a- to b- or g-{HBCDD} forms occurred, while {OH}-{HBCDD} was identiﬁed as a product of a-{HBCDD} metabolism. Irrespective of the strain, abdominal fat displayed the highest a-{HBCDD} concentration on a lipid weight basis, followed leg muscles and then breast muscle, liver and plasma. The accumulation ratios of a-{HBCDD} were slightly higher in {SG} (6.7, 2.1, 2.6 and 9.9 in leg muscles, breast muscle, liver and abdominal fat, respectively) than in {FG} broilers (5.2, 2.2, 1.1 and 8.4, respectively). The elimination half-lives in {SG} broilers were 20, 12 and 19 d in leg muscles, breast muscle and abdominal fat, respectively, to which dilution through growth contributed for around 50\%. The overall assimilation efﬁciency of a-{HBCDD} was estimated at 58 and 50\% in {FG} and {SG} broilers, respectively, while 22 and 17\% of a-{HBCDD} ingested were estimated to be eliminated in excreta as metabolites.},

Due to the complexity of metabolomics data, the variety of experimental designs, and the multiplicity of bioinformatics tools, providing experimenters with a simple and eﬃcient resource to conduct comprehensive and rigorous analysis of their data is of utmost importance. In 2014, we launched the Workﬂow4Metabolomics (W4M; http:// workﬂow4metabolomics.org) online infrastructure for metabolomics built on the Galaxy environment, which oﬀers user-friendly features to build and run data analysis workﬂows including preprocessing, statistical analysis, and annotation steps. Here we present the new W4M 3.0 release, which contains twice as many tools as the ﬁrst version, and provides two features which are, to our knowledge, unique among online resources. First, data from the four major metabolomics technologies (i.e., {LC}–{MS}, {FIA}–{MS}, {GC}–{MS}, and {NMR}) can be analyzed on a single platform. By using three studies in human physiology, alga evolution, and animal toxicology, we demonstrate how the 40 available tools can be easily combined to address biological issues. Second, the full analysis (including the workﬂow, the parameter values, the input data and output results) can be referenced with a permanent digital object identiﬁer ({DOI}). Publication of data analyses is of major importance for robust and reproducible science. Furthermore, the publicly shared workﬂows are of high-value for e-learning and training. The Workﬂow4Metabolomics 3.0 e-infrastructure thus not only oﬀers a unique online environment for analysis of data from the main metabolomics technologies, but it is also the ﬁrst reference repository for metabolomics workﬂows.},

However, the exact mechanisms underlying offspring metabolic adaptations are not yet fully understood. Specifically, it remains unclear whether the gestation or the lactation is the more vulnerable period to modify offspring metabolic flexibility. We investigated in a rodent model of intrauterine growth restriction ({IUGR}) induced by maternal protein restriction (R) during gestation which time window of maternal undernutrition (gestation, lactation or gestation–lactation) has more impact on the male offspring metabolomics phenotype. Plasma metabolome and hepatic lipidome of offspring were characterized through suckling period and at adulthood using liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry. Multivariate analysis of these fingerprints highlighted a persistent metabolomics signature in rats suckled by R dams, with a clear-cut discrimination from offspring fed by control (C) dams. Pups submitted to a nutritional switch at birth presented a metabolomics signature clearly distinct from that of pups nursed by dams maintained on a consistent perinatal diet. Control rats suckled by R dams presented transiently higher branched-chain amino acid ({BCAA}) oxidation during lactation besides increased fatty acid ({FA}) β-oxidation, associated with preserved insulin sensitivity and lesser fat accretion that persisted throughout their life. In contrast, {IUGR} rats displayed permanently impaired β-oxidation, associated to increased glucose or {BCAA} oxidation at adulthood, depending on the fact that pups experienced slow postnatal or catch-up growth, as suckled by R or C dams, respectively. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for a significant contribution of the lactation period in metabolic programming.},

	title = {L’approche métabolomique par spectrométrie de masse : évidences, incertitudes et points critiques},
	abstract = {Metabolomics is a methodological approach emerged in the late 2 000s in line with other «- omics» : genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. Like these other approaches, metabolomics is used in various fields and aims at measuring simultaneously all small endogenous metabolites ({\textless} 1 000 Da) impacted by a disturbance affecting a given biological system. Ultimately, these measures give insights in differences, often tenuous, between different states of a biological system. To achieve with confidence such a degree of sensitivity, it is necessary to master all the different steps of the approach. Metabolomics involves several disciplines (biology, chemistry, bioinformatics, and statistics) and such diversity multiplies the possibilities of confounding factors to arise and thus increases the sources of results misinterpretation. The expertise acquired over the years by researchers from the different areas involved in metabolomics can be briefly summarized in a generic workflow that from the experimental design to the biological interpretation of the data, intends at minimizing all sources of undesirable variability. All this is done in order to respond to this «simple» question : are the differences observed at the end of the process really and only linked to a biological reality ? Here, we discuss the first steps of a metabolomics study: experimental design, sample preparation, data acquisition and pre-processing, with the primary objective to provide clues for a critical assessment of the results and to provide the foundation for the successful implementation of a metabolomics study, in other words, a study meeting the quality criteria for an unbiased interpretation. Examples of illustration mainly refer to studies of mass spectrometric based untargeted metabolomics in the field of chemical food safety.},

In order to test whether these contaminations may originate from the ingestion of insulating materials in rearing buildings, a group of 55 hens raised in a collective cage was provided with a 64-g piece of extruded polystyrene ({XPS}, 2.59\% {HBCDD} of which 75, 15 and 10\% as a-, b- and g-{HBCDD}, respectively). Hens entirely consumed the piece within 3 days, leading to a mean daily exposure of 4.7 mg {HBCDD} per kg body weight. Whole egg {HBCDD} concentration reached a maximum of 1037 ng {HBCDD} {gÀ}1 fresh weight (fw), recorded 2 days after the piece had disappeared, and decreased down to 86 ng {gÀ}1 fw within the 19 following days. In all these samples, {HBCDD} was made of 98.7 ± 0.7 and 1.3 ± 0.6\% a- and b-{HBCDD}, respectively, and 0.1\% g-{HBCDD} when quantiﬁed; it was enriched in (À)a- and (þ)b-{HBCDD} with enantiomeric fractions of 0.438 ± 0.009 and 0.579 ± 0.030, respectively. {HBCDD} was quantiﬁed in all the individual eggs collected the last day of experiment at concentrations ranging between 0.47 and 1361 ng {gÀ}1 fw, according to a lognormal distribution. The ingestion of {XPS} in degraded rearing buildings is thus a plausible cause of on-farm egg contamination by {HBCDD} which should be strictly avoided.},

However, {IMS} also provides an extra separation dimension when it is coupled to traditional liquid chromatography or gas chromatographyemass spectrometry methods. Due to the enhancement of the resolving power, target analytes can be easier isolated from chemical background as well as isobaric and isomeric compounds are separated. In addition, collision cross section databases for residues and contaminants have been recently reported.

To examine whether {SAmPAP} exposure would result in ﬁsh contamination by perﬂuoroalkyl and polyﬂuoroalkyl substances ({PFASs}), juvenile Eurasian perch were dietarily exposed to this compound (dosed group) or exposed to the same tank water but fed control feed (control group). {SAmPAP} and metabolites were monitored in the muscle, liver, and serum during the 45-day exposure phase and 35-day depuration phase. {SAmPAP} was only detected in the dosed group and the absorption eﬃciency (0.04−2.25\%) was very low, possibly related to its low bioavailability in the gastrointestinal tract, steric constraints in crossing biological membranes, and clearing by enterohepatic circulation. Although {SAmPAP} was biotransformed and eliminated at a slow rate (t1/2 {\textgreater} 18 days), its biomagniﬁcation factor was low. The observed metabolites in ﬁsh were N-ethyl perﬂuorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid, perﬂuorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid, perﬂuorooctane sulfonamide, and {PFOS}. Considering that {SAmPAP} was the only source of {PFASs} in the tanks, the occurrence of metabolites indicates that {SAmPAP} could be biotransformed in ﬁsh and contribute to {PFOS} bioaccumulation. However, levels of metabolites were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in the dosed and control groups, indicating that metabolite excretion followed by re-exposure to these metabolites from water was the main uptake route.},

The work focuses on dioxin like {PCBs} in bovine meat in France. A modular Bayesian approach is proposed including measures after production, eﬀect of cooking, levels and frequency of consumption and eﬀect of digestion. In each module, a model is built and prior information can be integrated through previously acquired data commonly used in food risk assessment or vague priors. The output of the global model is the exposure including both production modes (organic and conventional) for three diﬀerent cooking intensities (rare, medium, and well-done), before digestion and after digestion. The main results show that organic meat is more contaminated than conventional meat in mean after production stage and after cooking although cooking reduces the contamination level.

The current pilot study aims to determine whether breast-milk lipidome had any impact on the early growth-pattern of preterm infants fed their own mother’s milk. A prospective-monocentric-observational birth-cohort was established, enrolling 138 preterm infants, who received their own mother’s breast-milk throughout hospital stay. All infants were ranked according to the change in weight Z-score between birth and hospital discharge. Then, we selected infants who experienced “slower” (n = 15, −1.54 ± 0.42 Z-score) or “faster” (n = 11, −0.48 ± 0.19 Z-score) growth; as expected, although groups did not differ regarding gestational age, birth weight Z-score was lower in the “faster-growth” group (0.56 ± 0.72 vs. −1.59 ± 0.96). Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry lipidomic signatures combined with multivariate analyses made it possible to identify breast-milk lipid species that allowed clear-cut discrimination between groups. Validation of the selected biomarkers was performed using multidimensional statistical, false-discovery-rate and {ROC} (Receiver Operating Characteristic) tools. Breast-milk associated with faster growth contained more medium-chain saturated fatty acid and sphingomyelin, dihomo-γ-linolenic acid ({DGLA})-containing phosphethanolamine, and less oleic acid-containing triglyceride and {DGLA}-oxylipin. The ability of such biomarkers to predict early-growth was validated in presence of confounding clinical factors but remains to be ascertained in larger cohort studies.},

An unresolved question is the capacity of the {HFA} to produce potent androgen {DHT} via conventional and/or the backdoor pathway(s) at the end of first trimester, when androgen-responsive organs are developed. Our aim was to explore steroidogenesis and the expression of steroidogenic enzymes and transcription factors in {HFA} at gestational weeks ({GW}) 9–12 with focus on their androgenic potential. Steroids in the {HFA} were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The expression of steroidogenic enzymes and transcription factors in the {HFA} at {GW}9–12 was investigated by {qPCR}, automated Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. We demonstrated that during {GW}9–12 {HFA} produced steroids of the ∆5, ∆4 and the backdoor pathways of the biosynthesis of {DHT}, though the latter was limited to production of 17α-{OH}-dihydroprogesterone, androsterone and androstanedione without further conversion to {DHT}. The only androgens identified in the {HFA} were testosterone and androsterone, a precursor in the biosynthesis of {DHT}. We also observed higher levels of {CYP}17A1 but low expression of 3{βHSD}2 at {GW}11–12 in the {HFA}. Elevated levels of {CYP}17A1 were associated with an increased expression of {SF}-1 and {GATA}-6. Altogether, our data demonstrate that of those steroids analyzed, the only potent androgen directly produced by the {HFA} at {GW}9–12 was testosterone. The onset of steroidogenesis in the {HFA} is a complex process that is regulated by the coordinated action of related transcription factors.},

	abstract = {Bisphenol A ({BPA}) is used in a wide variety of products and objects for consumers use (digital media such as {CD}'s and {DVD}'s, sport equipment, food and beverage containers, medical equipment). For humans, the main route of exposure to {BPA} is food. Based on previous estimates, almost 20\% of the dietary exposure to {BPA} in the French population would be from food of animal origin. However, due to the use of composite samples, the source of the contamination had not been identiﬁed. Therefore, 322 individual samples of non-canned foods of animal origin were collected with the objectives of ﬁrst updating the estimation of the exposure of the French population and second identifying the source of contamination of these foodstuﬀs using a speciﬁc analytical method. Compared to previous estimates in France, a decline in the contamination of the samples was observed, in particular with regard to meat. The estimated mean dietary exposures ranged from 0.048 to 0.050 μg (kg bw)−1 d−1 for 3–17 year children and adolescents, from 0.034 to 0.035 μg (kg bw)−1 d−1 for adults and from 0.047 to 0.049 μg (kg bw)−1 d−1 for pregnant women. The contribution of meat to total dietary exposure of pregnant women, adults and children was up to three times lower than the previous estimates. Despite this downward trend in contamination, the toxicological values were observed to have been exceeded for the population of pregnant women. With the aim of acquiring more knowledge about the origin the potential source(s) of contamination of non-canned foods of animal origin, a speciﬁc analytical method was developed to directly identify and quantify the presence of conjugated {BPA} ({BPA}-monoglucuronide, {BPA}-diglucuronide and sulphate forms) in 50 samples. No conjugated forms of {BPAs} were detected in the analysed samples, indicating clearly that {BPA} content in animal food was not due to metabolism but arise post mortem in food. This contamination may occur during food production. However, despite extensive sampling performed in several diﬀerent shops (butcheries, supermarkets …. ) and in diﬀerent conditions (fresh, prepared, frozen …), the source(s) of the contamination could not be speciﬁcally identiﬁed.},

	abstract = {Endometriosis is a gynaecological disease characterized by the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue. Histologically, it appears as diﬀerent sub-types, being peritoneal endometriosis, ovarian endometrioma ({OvE}) and deep inﬁltrating endometriosis ({DIE}), which are of major relevance due to their varying clinical presentations. A number of persistent organic pollutants ({POPs}) have been associated with the onset of endometriosis, yet the overall set of existing studies remains fairly divergent. In this preliminary case-control study we aimed to assess the potential associations between the internal exposure to {POPs} and the presence of {DIE} with or without concurrent {OvE}. Adipose tissue and serum samples were collected from surgically conﬁrmed cases (n = 55) and controls (n = 44) enrolled during 2013 and 2015 in Pays de la Loire, France. Targeted pollutants (76 historical or more emerging {POPs} including dioxins, polychlorobiphenyls ({PCB}), polybrominated diphenyl ethers ({PBDEs}), polybrominated biphenyls ({PBBs}), hexabromocyclododecanes ({HBCDs}) and organochlorine pesticides ({OCPs}) were quantiﬁed by chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Odds ratios ({ORs}) and 95\% conﬁdence intervals ({CI}) were estimated from unconditional logistic regression adjusted for known confounding variables. The results showed signiﬁcant associations between {DIE} and adipose tissue levels of 1.2.3.7.8 – {PeCDD}, {OCDF}, {PCB} 105, 114, 118 and 123, {PBDE} 183, {PBB} 153, and several {OCPs} including trans‑nonachlor, cis‑heptachlor epoxide, dieldrin, β-hexachlorocyclohexane and hexachlorobenzene. The largest associations were observed for {OCDF} followed by cis‑heptachlor epoxide, exhibiting adjusted {ORs} (95\% {CI}) of 5.42 (2.73–12.85) and 5.36 (2.44–14.84) per 1-{SD} increase, respectively. The stratiﬁed analysis comparing both disease sub-types suggested that adipose tissue exposure markers may be more associated with {DIE} concurrent with {OvE}, however these results need to be conﬁrmed in a larger population.},

All the concentrations were below regulatory limits. In muscles, Cu, Zn and As were measured at slightly higher levels in organic samples but no diﬀerences between organic and Label Rouge was observed. Livers from conventional and Label Rouge pig farms exhibited higher Zn and Cd contents than the organic ones, probably due to diﬀerent practice in zinc or phytase supplementation of fattening diets. Principal component analysis indicated a correlation between Cu and As concentrations in liver and carcass weight, and between Zn and Cd liver levels and lean meat percentage. The linear discriminant analysis succeeded in predicting the farming process on the basis of the lean meat percentage and the liver Cd level.},

	abstract = {Introduction  Although it is still at a very early stage compared to its mass spectrometry ({MS}) counterpart, proton nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) lipidomics is worth being investigated as an original and complementary solution for lipidomics. Dedicated sample preparation protocols and adapted data acquisition methods have to be developed to set up an {NMR} lipidomics workflow; in particular, the considerable overlap observed for lipid signals on 1D spectra may hamper its applicability.
Objectives  The study describes the development of a complete proton {NMR} lipidomics workflow for application to serum fingerprinting. It includes the assessment of fast 2D {NMR} strategies, which, besides reducing signal overlap by spreading the signals along a second dimension, offer compatibility with the high-throughput requirements of food quality characterization.
Method  The robustness of the developed sample preparation protocol is assessed in terms of repeatability and ability to provide informative fingerprints; further, different {NMR} acquisition schemes—including classical 1D, fast 2D based on nonuniform sampling or ultrafast schemes—are evaluated and compared. Finally, as a proof of concept, the developed workflow is applied to characterize lipid profiles disruption in serum from β-agonists diet fed pigs.
Results  Our results show the ability of the workflow to discriminate efficiently sample groups based on their lipidic profile, while using fast 2D {NMR} methods in an automated acquisition framework.
Conclusion  This work demonstrates the potential of fast multidimensional 1H {NMR}—suited with an appropriate sample preparation—for lipidomics fingerprinting as well as its applicability to address chemical food safety issues.},

The proposed workﬂow relies on the optimization of an adequate {SPE} extraction step followed by an {UHPLC}-{HRMS}/{MS} simultaneous analysis of both free and conjugated forms of C18, C19 and C21 steroid hormones. On the basis of 44 selected steroids, representative of main classes of steroids constituting the steroidome, the performances of the developed workﬂow were evaluated in terms of selectivity, repeatability ({\textless} 13\%) and linearity (R2 {\textgreater} 0.985 in the concentration range [0.01–10 ng/{mL}]). As metabolites identiﬁcation and characterization constitute the bottleneck of such proﬁling approaches, a homemade database was created encompassing a large number of characterized free and conjugated steroids (n {\textgreater} 150) for putative steroid-like biomarkers identiﬁcation purposes. The eﬃciency of the workﬂow in highlighting ﬁne modiﬁcations within the urinary steroidome was assessed in the frame of an anabolic treatment involving an intra-muscular administration of boldenone undecylenate (2 mg/kg) to veals (n=6) and the investigation of potential steroid biomarkers. Besides monitoring known phase {II} metabolites of boldenone in the bovine specie, namely, boldenone glucuronide and sulfate, the applied strategy also permitted to observe, upon boldenone administration, a modiﬁed proﬁle of epiboldenone glucuronide. Furthermore, 31 signals corresponding to non-identiﬁed steroid species could also be highlighted as impacted upon the exogenous steroid treatment. This study is the ﬁrst to simultaneously investigate both free and conjugated C18, C19 and C21 steroid hormones in their native form using {UHPLC}-{HRMS}/{MS} and allowing their comprehensive proﬁling.

Little is known about the fate and eﬀect of these compounds in birds, especially during the vulnerable stages of embryonic development. To investigate the ability of birds to biotransform these compounds, an in ovo exposure experiment with Japanese quail eggs was performed. Quail eggs were injected in the yolk sac with 1000 ng/g egg of {TDCIPP} (2.3 nmol/g ww), {DP} (1.5 nmol/g ww) or a mixture of both and were then incubated at 37.5 °C for 17 days. To get a time-integrated understanding of the in ovo transformation of the compounds, one egg per treatment was removed from the incubator every day and analyzed for {TDCIPP} and its metabolite bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate ({BDCIPP}) and/or for {DP}. By the end of the incubation period, {TDCIPP} was completely metabolized, while simultaneously {BDCIPP} was formed. The conversion of the parent compound into the metabolite did not occur proportionally and the concentration of {BDCIPP} showed a tendency to decrease when {TDCIPP} became depleted, both indicating that {BDCIPP} was further transformed into compounds not targeted for analysis. Further untargeted investigations did not show the presence of other metabolites, possibly due to the volatility of the metabolites. On the other hand, the {DP} concentration did not decrease during egg incubation. This study indicates that within the incubation period, avian embryos are able to biotransform {TDCIPP}, but not {DP}.},

	abstract = {An untargeted strategy aiming at identifying non-intentionally added substances ({NIAS}) migrating from coatings was developed. This innovative approach was applied to two polyester-polyurethane lacquers, for which suppliers previously provided the identity of the monomers involved. Lacquers were extracted with acetonitrile and analyzed by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry ({LC}-{HRMS}). Data, acquired in the full scan mode, were processed using an open-source Renvironment (xcms and {CAMERA} packages) to list the detected features and deconvolute them in groups related to individual compounds. The most intense groups, accounting for more than 85\% of cumulated feature intensities, were then investigated. A homemade database, populated with predicted polyester oligomer combinations from a relevant selection of diols and diacids, enabled highlighting the presence of 14 and 17 cyclic predicted polyester oligomers in the two lacquers, including three mutual combinations explained by common known monomers. Combination hypotheses were strengthened by chromatographic considerations and by the investigation of fragmentation patterns. Regarding unpredicted migrating substances, four monomers were hypothesised to explain several polyester or caprolactam oligomer series. Finally, considering both predicted and tentatively elucidated unpredicted oligomers, it was possible to assign hypotheses to features representing up to 82\% and 90\% of the cumulated intensities in the two lacquers, plus 9\% and 3\% (respectively) originating from the procedural blank.},

The global production volumes of {MCCPs} are nowadays suspected to be much higher than those of S- and {LCCPs}, and the few available studies on the environmental occurrence of chlorinated paraﬃns report often higher {MCCP} concentrations than S- or {LCCP} concentrations in the environment. The present review focuses, therefore, on {MCCPs} speciﬁcally and provides a literature overview and a data analysis of the production volumes, {PBT} properties (persistence, bioaccumulation potential, and toxicity), and the worldwide measured concentrations of {MCCP} in environmental samples, biota, and humans. Furthermore, we include our own measurements of technical {CP} formulations from China, the major global producing country, to estimate the global production amounts of {MCCPs}. The key ﬁndings from this review are that (1) {MCCPs} are toxic to the aquatic environment, and the available data suggest that they are also persistent; (2) available time trends for {MCCPs} in soil, biota, and most of the sediment cores show increasing time trends over the last years to decades; and (3) {MCCP} concentrations in sediment close to local sources exceed toxicity thresholds (i.e., the {PNEC}). Our study shows that overall, {MCCPs} are of growing concern, and regulatory actions should be considered seriously.},

Chlorinated oleﬁns ({COs}) are expected thermal {CP} transformation products that are present in technical {CP} products and in the environment. Thus, a speciﬁc analysis of {CPs} and {COs} is important. Commonly, {CPs} are analysed by gas chromatography electron capture negative ionisation mass spectrometry ({GC}-{ECNI}-{MS}). It was shown that {GC}-{ECNI}-{MS} suffers from in-source formation of {COs}. Further, selected ion monitoring can lead to false quantiﬁcation of {COs} as {CPs}. Alternative methods based on liquid chromatography and soft ionisation techniques can solve the {CP}/{CO} problem. Non-interfered {CP} data is inevitable for {CP} transformation studies and non-biased degradation kinetics. Data about {CP} transformation is urgently needed, but respective studies are challenging. In here, we provided an analytical guide to deal with severe mass interferences of {CPs} and their transformation products.},

A particular attention has been paid to background contamination management at any stage of the analytical process, from the sampling to the expression of the results.

The atypical physico-chemical properties of chlordecone make its inclusion in classical analytical approaches non applicable. The aim of our work was to include chlordecone in a multi organochlorine residue method preventing any degradation during the analytical process and thus allowing quantiﬁcation at ppt (ng kg−1 or ng L−1) levels for a wide range of {OCPs} in breast milk, human serum and adipose tissue. After {GC}–{HRMS} vs. {MS}/{MS} and {EI} vs. {APCI} comparisons, the major improvement in terms of sensitivity was found in decreasing the length and ﬁlm thickness of the gas chromatography column. Thanks to a linear correlation between relative response and quantity of chlordecone injected, {LC}-({ESI}-)-{MS}/{MS} was ﬁnally preferred. An acetonitrile based gradient optimized on a C30 coreshell {HPLC} column has led to reaching limits of quantiﬁcation as low as 8 ng L−1, 25 pg {mL}−1 and 0.2 ng g−1 fat for breast milk, serum and adipose tissue, respectively, allowing multiresidue {OCP} quantiﬁcation at concentration levels compatible with biomonitoring purposes and pre-requisites.},

Recently, endogenous sources of thiouracil were identiﬁed after frequently monitoring low-level thiouracil positive urine samples and a “recommend concentration” ({RC}) of 10 μg/L was suggested by the {EURL} to facilitate decision-making. However, the systematic occurrence of urine samples exceeding the {RC} led to demands for international surveys deﬁning an epidemiologic threshold. Therefore, six European member states (France, Poland, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, Norway, and Belgium) have shared their oﬃcial thiouracil data (2010−2012) collected from bovines, porcines, and small livestock with 95 and 99\% percentiles of 8.1 and 18.2 μg/L for bovines (n = 3894); 7.4 and 13.5 μg/L for porcines (n = 654); and 7.4 μg/L (95\% only) for small livestock (n = 85), respectively. Bovine percentiles decreased with the animal age (nonadults had signiﬁcantly higher levels for bovines), and higher levels were observed in male bovines compared to female bovines.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Invasive breast carcinoma is the most common cancer in women as in non-ovariectomised pet dogs, which are already identified as a valuable spontaneous preclinical model for that disease. Geographical and time trends suggest that environmental factors may play an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of breast cancer. Persistent organic pollutants ({POPs}) fit perfectly with these trends and are known to interact with hormonal receptors implicated in breast cancer subtyping. The aim of this innovating study was to evaluate the interest of the companion dog model in assessing chemical exposure and breast cancer associations, in order to identify common etiological features with the human disease in a context of comparative oncology.
Methods: We monitored a hundred of molecules belonging to a large panel of {POPs} (dioxins, dioxin-like and non dioxin-like polychlorobisphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, brominated flame retardants, perfluorinated alkylated substances) in companion dogs diagnosed for mammary adenocarcinoma (n = 54) and non cancer controls (n = 47).
Results: All targeted chemical families were able to be detected in canine samples. We identified pollutants associated with mammary cancer belonging to the dioxin like-{PCB} family (notably {PCB}-118, -156, -105, -114) that were already pointed out in human epidemiological studies on breast cancer, and that fit with the fundamental role of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor in the promotion of breast cancer.
Conclusions: Similarities observed in the spontaneous dog model are very helpful to progress in interpretation of human breast cancer-environment relationships. This study provides a new insight focusing on this discrete but recurrent signature.},

	abstract = {Perinatal undernutrition affects not only fetal and neonatal growth but also adult health outcome, as suggested by the metabolic imprinting concept. Although maternal milk is the only channel through which nutrients are transferred from mother to offspring during the postnatal period, the impact of maternal undernutrition on milk composition is poorly understood. The present study investigates, in a rat model of nutritional programming, the effects of feeding an isocaloric, low-protein diet throughout gestation and lactation on milk composition and its possible consequences on offspring’s growth and metabolic status. We used an integrated methodological approach that combined targeted analyses of macronutrients, free amino acid and fatty acid content throughout lactation, with an untargeted mass-spectrometric-based metabolomic phenotyping. Whereas perinatal dietary protein restriction failed to alter milk protein content, it dramatically decreased the concentration of most free amino acids at the end of lactation. Interestingly, a decrease of several amino acids involved in insulin secretion or gluconeogenesis was observed, suggesting that maternal protein restriction during the perinatal period may impact the insulinotrophic effect of milk, which may, in turn, account for the slower growth of the suckled male offspring. Besides, the decrease in sulfur amino acids may alter redox status in the offspring. Maternal undernutrition was also associated with an increase in milk total fatty acid content, with modifications in their pattern. Altogether, our results show that milk composition is clearly influenced by maternal diet and suggest that alterations in milk composition may play a role in offspring growth and metabolic programming.},

In this paper, the potential of Synapt G2-S (Q-{TWIM}-{TOF} {MS}) has been investigated for sensitive and speciﬁc detection of a range of these synthetic phenethanolamines in various complex biological matrices (retina, meat, and urine) from bovine considered as relevant in the context of detecting β-adrenergic agonists use in animals. In particular, the speciﬁcity of the additional information provided by the {TWIMS} (i.e., collision cross section) together with the interest of the extra dimension of separation is discussed.},

	abstract = {The safety and quality of infant milk, whether it is breast milk ({BM}) or infant formula ({IF}), are a major concern for parents and public health authorities. {BM} is recommended as the gold standard at {WHO} level. However, nowadays {IF} appears as an essential alternative in Western countries, challenging producers to optimize nutritional quality and safety of {IF}. The aim of the present article is to give an overview on the assessment and comparison of risks and beneﬁts associated with {BM} and {IF} consumption. To date, this intensively debated subject has been mainly investigated. It has been shown that both diets could be sources of beneﬁcial health effects in terms of nutrition and also risks in terms of chemical safety. Moreover, microbiologists have demonstrated that {IF} consumption can cause illness due to product contamination or inappropriate milk preparation. The article concludes on the bottlenecks and gaps that should be investigated to further progress the quantiﬁcation of the impact of early diet on infant health. Performing a multi-disciplinary risk-beneﬁt assessment with {DALY} as endpoint might be a future option to help prioritize management options.},

Testicular Leydig cells ({LCs}) are suggested to be among the main targets of phthalate toxicity in the body. However, their sensitivity to phthalates is species-dependent. This paper describes the response of the {LCs} from different species (mouse, rat and human) to phthalate exposure in different experimental paradigms (in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro), with particular focus on mechanisms of phthalate action on {LC} steroidogenesis. A comprehensive analysis of the impact of phthalate diesters and phthalate monoesters on {LCs} in different stages of their development is presented and possible mechanisms of phthalates action are discussed. Finally novel, not yet fully elucidated sites of action of phthalate monoesters on the backdoor pathway of 5α-dihydrotestosterone biosynthesis in immature mouse {LCs} and their effects on steroidogenesis and redox state in adult mouse {LCs} are reported.},
